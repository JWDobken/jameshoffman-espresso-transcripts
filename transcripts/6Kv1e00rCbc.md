## Buying A Vintage Espresso Machine

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kv1e00rCbc>

This picture behind me depicts
the Roman Bridge in Rimini
and it hangs here in
Rimini in the City Museum.
It was painted by a
Welshman, Richard Wilson.
He came here in the 1750s,
sketched the bridge,
took those sketches home
and painted this picture.
It's considered important
because it's a great depiction
of what is considered
a very important piece
of Roman architecture.
But more than that, it has a
wider consequence and meaning.
This was an influential picture.
Other painters saw it and
decided to come to Rimini.
Rimini had not been part
of the Grand Tour of Europe
that many British artists were
taking, and suddenly it was.
You might ask, quite fairly,
what on earth has this
got to do with coffee?
I was approached by Masterworks
about sponsoring a video.
They allow you to invest in
fine and contemporary art
and we'll talk about them later.
But they made me think about art again,
about what I enjoy about art.
They made me think about investing in art
and then they made me think
about what does investing
in art in coffee mean?
And the answer, to me, is
actually pretty simple:
it means vintage espresso machines.
Something that I have loved
from the moment that I got into coffee,
the moment that I saw them,
these old machines just appealed to me
but I've never bought one
and I've always wanted to.
The idea of something
old really appeals to me.
There's something about the fact
that 200 years ago this
artist painted this canvas,
this work right here.
That's meaningful to me.
And the idea of drinking coffee
from a machine that's 50, 60 years old
is also meaningful to me.
And that brings me to Rimini
because not far from here is
the workshop of Enrico Maltoni.
Now, Enrico is probably
the foremost collector
of vintage espresso machines in the world.
You might know
the MUMAC Museum of
espresso machines in Milan,
that's his collection,
but out here he has his
restoration workshop
and we're gonna head there next.
See him at work,
talk to him about vintage
espresso machines,
how to buy them, what to look out for,
is it a good investment?
And maybe, just maybe,
I can convince him to sell me something.
So I've known about Enrico
pretty much since I've worked in coffee,
I don't really know what he's
gonna have in his workshop.
He obviously has all his
collection at the museum,
I'm hoping he has some
fun stuff there, too.
I dunno what we're gonna see
but I am undeniably excited.
(upbeat music)
So I'm here in Enrico Maltoni's workshop
and I feel like a kid in a candy shop.
This is, this is incredible.
This place is incredible.
I've come to ask some questions
but I could shoot 10 different videos
of all of the stuff he
has squirreled away here.
There's prototypes, there's
things I've never seen before.
I feel like I have to
capture some extra stuff,
but I wanna ask him questions.
I wanna ask about buying
old espresso machines.
Now, Enrico doesn't speak English
and that's okay, we've
got some translation,
but I want to interview him
and understand his experience.
Get some of his knowledge,
learn a little bit more
about the market for
vintage espresso machines
because I want one
and I still don't really
understand if this is a good idea.

- [James] Is that the only machine
  with that group head style,
  where the portafilter moves up and down?
- So what we're gonna do now
  is take the opportunity to
  open up a restored machine
  and see what they look like on the inside
  because the outside,
  obviously, is beautiful.
  This machine, I think
  from 1963, it's a Faema,
  I wanna know what it's like on the inside?
  I also just want to own this.
  With me to talk about this is Matteo
  who looks after the workshop here,
  he's in charge of all of
  the restoration stuff here,
  so let's take it to pieces.
  (Ooh)
  So, this piece is the one
  that we just took off the
  back of the machine before.
  This, there's a lot of restoration
  in this one piece, right?
- In the restoration process
  which bit adds the most cost,
  you know what I mean,
  which adds the most
  expense in the whole build?
- Okay. How long would this
  restoration have taken?
- But, as far as the coffee is concerned,
  this machine is the same as
  it was when it was built,
  you know what I mean?
  If you're the puck of coffee,
  the temperature of the water,
  the way the whole machine
  works, is the same.
- Yes.
  All right. Can we make coffee with this?
  I feel very nervous.
  I feel weirdly nervous to use this
  only 'cause I don't know what I'm doing
  and I don't really use
  lever machines very much.
  So, down?
- Yes, pull down.
  Five seconds.
- Okay.
  And then a little up and a little down?
- Yes.
- Like now?
  So, like here and down.
- Okay,
  and up.
- And up again
  and then let go?
  Oh, that looks pretty nice.
  This is actually a
  really important part of
  the whole experience for me,
  this is a rare experience
  and that changes the way the
  coffee tastes a little bit.
  It's not as much about the
  coffee and the blend right now
  as in the machine that made it
  that makes this memorable to me.
  Thank you.
  I need quite a lot of prep
  on how to use these things
  'cause I have no idea.
  Now what is interesting,
  Enrico just told me,
  this is the first model
  that had "crema caff√®
  naturale" on the back.
  The first time that the term
  'crema' was used for espresso
  and it was a redefinition
  of coffee this way.
  It's great marketing
  and it's a word we use all the time now.
  This machine, not this exact
  model or this exact unit,
  but when they started making this
  in the very late 40s, early
  50s, this defined crema
  and I just think that's cool.
  I'm gonna try and make coffee with it.
  All right, so (groans)
  feel good about life now.
  Click, five seconds,
  which feels about now?
  Now?
- Yes, yes.
  (spring creaking)
- There we go.
  This is the taste of history
  and coffee.
  (chuckles)
  Oh dear.
  You know, there's no denying
  it, I really want one.
  I really, really want to
  own an old espresso machine.
  It may not be a sound financial decision.
  I'm not sure I can justify
  it as an investment
  even with the guidance
  of an expert like Enrico,
  but talking about investments
  does bring us to the sponsor of this video
  and it's, I guess,
  now time for a short ad about Masterworks.
  Now, Masterworks is a unique platform
  that let's you invest in
  fine and contemporary art,
  something that was pretty exclusive,
  pretty hard to get into until now.
  It lets you invest in a range of artists
  going from, say, Banksy through to Monet.
  Now we are talking about investments
  and so it's important to say,
  if you're investing your money
  your investments can go down as well as up
  and me talking about this
  does not constitute financial advice.
  But what Masterworks are
  doing is really interesting.
  Most people would tell you,
  most wealth managers would tell you,
  you should diversify your portfolio
  and this is definitely an
  interesting way to do that.
  In fact, if you look at
  the world of fine art,
  it's a growing world.
  More than that,
  I think fine and
  contemporary art in one study
  had outpaced the S&P 500
  by 164% from 1995 to 2021.
  It's been great here
  having access to an expert
  and Masterworks is the same,
  you're using their expertise
  in your investments,
  you're not going in
  blind and going in alone.
  If you're interested in Masterworks
  and you wanna gain priority access,
  then there's a link in the
  description down below.
  Thank you so much to Masterworks
  for sponsoring this video.
  Now I have to convince
  Enrico to sell me something.
  It's time to go shopping.
  Okay, I want one. I want something.
  And I think the thing is
  I don't just want something for home.
  What I have in mind,
  I wanna be able to serve coffee
  from this to lots of people.
  What have you got?
- This one?
- How much would something like this be?
- Okay.
  Okay, that's,
  I don't know what I
  thought it was going to be.
  I don't know if I thought
  that was high or low
  but that seems very fair,
  actually, for something like this.
  Is there anything else you have?
- Okay, let's go.
- Mm, yes.
- How long will this take to restore?
- Okay.
- How much?
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah (laughs)
- [James] How much?
- That's nice. That's
  really nice, actually.
  You have a deal.
- Sold.
  Okay, because I need to
  explain just to you watching,
  why would I buy this? It's not just -
  I'm not just buying a one
  group to keep at home for me.
  I have a plan.
  I want to share the experience
  of drinking coffee from an old machine
  and so that's why,
  that's why I was looking
  for maybe a two group
  or even a three group,
  but a two group is kind of perfect
  because I wanna put it in
  a cafe in a public space.
  The painful bit now
  is going to be waiting
  to see this transform.
  So we'll get a load of pictures now of it,
  so you can see the before
  and when you see it
  again in a future video
  you'll see the after, you'll
  see the restored version.
  And I'll tell you, if
  you're around London,
  maybe how you can drink
  some coffee from it.
  I've had an incredible
  day. I've had the most fun.
  And I feel like I've barely
  scratched the surface
  of all of the different
  things in this building.
  There's just so many
  parts, machines, things
  that are full of stories
  that I could do a whole
  video about just one of them,
  but there's no time.
  Today has been a successful
  day. I'm very excited.
  I go away, potentially the
  owner of a very beautiful thing.
  I can't wait. I'm very impatient.
  It will be a long 30 days
  until I can get my hands on that thing
  but I'll share as much as
  I can, as soon as I can
  on that front.
  I wanna know from you, which
  one of these machines today
  has been the most beautiful for you?
  Leave me a comment down below.
  I am super grateful to Enrico and Matteo
  for hosting me here.
  It's been a great day
  but it's time to go and
  get a plane, go home.
  So for now, I'll say thank
  you so much for watching
  and I hope you have a great day.
