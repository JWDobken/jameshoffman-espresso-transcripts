## Understanding Espresso: Pressure (Episode #6)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3oGIicu-8>

Welcome to the final installment
of Understanding Espresso.
A series where we've gone
through each of the variables
in espresso making and
looked at how to use them,
how they impact your espresso making.
In order to sort of understand the process
of dialing in better and to
make more delicious coffee.
Now, this last episode is one
that I didn't actually plan
to make at the beginning.
I was gonna stick to sort of the basics
of kind of coffee in,
coffee out, grind size,
that kind of stuff, brew temperature.
Here I think it's important
that we talk about pressure.
It's been a growing
conversation in coffee.
It did reach a bit of a
fervour pitch a few years ago,
it's calmed down a bit since then.
And the conversation has moved
from pressure to some extent to flow.
We will touch on that in a
little bit, but to start us off
I'm gonna go back to the beginning.
A kind of quick history of
pressure in espresso brewing.
The first espresso machines operated
at relatively low pressures.
They would boil water, trap that steam
and use that pent-up
steam pressure to push
the boiling water through coffee.
Maybe one to two bars of pressure
was kind of where they were operating
but this meant you could
brew coffee quicker
than you ever could before.
And puck, that combination
of quick and pressing
is where espresso got its name from.
Now the big innovation for
sort of modernist espresso came
from Achille Gaggia's machine in 1949.
Here he made a massive leap in pressure.
Now, pressures had been
increasing in various innovations
in machines running up to
this, but no one had gotten
near the pressures that he
achieved with his spring lever.
And here you had a lever
that you pulled down,
this compressed a big spring,
allowed water into a brew chamber
and then when you released the lever,
that spring expanding, pushed
that water through the coffee.
And here was the first time
that we had enough pressure
to generate creamer.
Now, if you wanna know more about creamer,
there's a video up here
going into the kind of how's
and why's and what's of creamer,
but it was a huge moment
and a kind of turning point for espresso.
The next leap forward in brew pressure
I would say came in 1961 with
one of the most interesting
and innovative machines,
which is the Faema E61
which probably deserves
a video all of its own,
at some point.
Now, amongst its many
innovations was the fact
that it used an electric pump
and this provided a constant
pressure to brew espresso out,
unlike the springs, because
as the spring expands
it exerts less force.
Here we suddenly had nine bars of pressure
as a kind of new constant
in espresso brewing.
The next big leap I would say
was probably the introduction
of pressure profiling.
I think that can be mostly credited
to La Marzocco strata
machine that came out
around 2009, 2010.
Here it still had an electric
pump, but it was a gear pump.
Where you could send a variable
voltage and it would spin
and produce varying kind of pressures.
And suddenly you could
create whatever pressure
you wanted to, whenever
you wanted to in the shot,
this was new, this was interesting.
And the phrase, pressure
profiling came into
the collective conscious
of coffee brewing people.
It was an interesting time,
a time of experimentation,
of discovery and also enormous frustration
because you can change one
small part of a pressure curve
in espresso shot and it will taste
a different tasting espresso.
And that's initially exciting,
but soon it's difficult to know
if you're making your espresso
better or just different.
I think now we have a more
measured approach that comes
with a little bit more understanding
of what's been going on
inside our espressos.
And we know a little bit more
about how to use pressure
to achieve better and
more consistent espresso.
Now, before we get into the
two sections that are talking
about pre-infusion and
talking about the sort of
main brewing section and pressures there,
I do quickly wanna talk
about nine bars of pressure.
This is the norm, this is the standard.
This is what most espresso
machines are set to from factory
in terms of commercial machines, for sure
but why is it nine bars?
I did once hear that this was
considered to be the average
of a spring profile, right?
A spring lever will peak higher than nine
and will slowly decline
as the spring expands
in a kind of linear version.
And someone said nine was the average.
Maybe, what seems more likely
is that someone did the work
and worked out that there's
a peak of flow at nine bars.
You can read about this
in, I think Illie's book
which is The Science of Quality
and also Scott Roo's book
which was an ebook about espresso making.
I'll link everything down
below in the description.
If you do a simple test, you
take a fixed dose of coffee,
at a fixed ground setting and you brew
let's say for 30 seconds and you brew
at seven bars, eight bars,
nine bars, 10 bars, 11 bars.
What you'll see is that as
you increase in pressure
more liquid gets through that coffee puck
in a fixed amount of time.
The flow increases until you
cross the nine bar threshold.
And actually the pressure of
the water starts to compact
the cake making it harder
to get through again.
And your flow starts to decrease again.
So nine bars is about
ish, the peak of flow
for most espresso
machines, this makes sense.
This is the setting that would
allow you to grind the finest
for a given kind of flow rate.
So that's where nine bars
comes from most likely.
So let's talk about pre-infusion
because I think that's
the most common place
that people think about pressure
or variances in pressure.
As a definition pre-infusion
starts the moment
that water enters the basket
or brew chamber generally
and ends when the machine has reached
its peak brewing pressure.
In this phase, we're typically
looking to get all of
the coffee evenly wet before a big force
of water presses right
through it at high pressures.
In theory having a
longer pre-infusion phase
promotes evenness of extraction
and produces better tasting coffee.
Now, the way that
different machines do this
is kind of interesting.
And there's some sort of automated
or sort of mechanical solutions to this.
And there's some more technical
solutions to it as well.
The most common one in commercial machines
is called flow restriction.
And here closer to the pump
than to the group head
typically but not always
is a small restrictor.
The hole that might be
0.6 millimeters wide
and what'll happen here
is the pump will kick on
all the pressure will
get up to that restrictor
and a sort of jet of
water will get through
but it will restrict the flow.
And it isn't until water has filled
from the restrict to
all the way to the park
that the full pressure of
the pump can be translated
through to the park of the coffee.
On a standard machine this will usually
take six or seven seconds.
And after you push go, you'll
see the pressure come up
on the gauge and then very
slightly right at the end,
lift just a little bit more.
And that little lifted
pressure is the final moment
when you know, the whole system
has become fully pressurized
and the pump pressure
is now hitting the puck.
Different flourishes will produce
different pre-infusion
levels that they will
to some extent restrict
the potential overall flow, 0.6
to 0.8 is relatively common.
Unrestricted machines mean
that you have no real pre-infusion phase
and coffee will appear from
your spouts incredibly quickly.
Generally speaking, I
want to see it takes six
to eight seconds on a
normal nine bar machine
with some pre-infusion
for liquid to appear.
The reason people don't like
flow restrictors in lots
of parts of the world
is that these tiny holes
can very quickly fill
with scale and block.
And then that whole group
head is out of action
and commercially that's
a bit of a headache.
So if you're not on top
of your water filtration,
you're in trouble.
Some machines have that flow restriction
in the cold water sort of circuit
before the water is heated up.
And that's sensible from
a scale perspective.
Once the water is hot
it is more likely to precipitate scale.
Other machines do have their
restriction in the hot side
and that is just a bit more of a concern.
Neither is right or better,
but that's typically
what's driving the decision
to place the restrictions
in different places.
Personally, I quite like flow
restriction for pre-infusion.
It's mechanical, it's
simple, it's repeatable.
It's the same every single time.
And I get enough pre-infusion that I feel
like I can grind fine enough
and have a nice high yield
and have a good time.
I don't have to pay attention
or think about it commercially
in a busy environment,
especially it's a great solution.
You can go further
and have what's called a
pre-infusion space or a block
that's an extra chamber above the coffee
that also has to fill that
draws out the whole procedure
a little bit more.
It takes longer for the
system to pressurize.
Those are okay, those work quite well.
They'll let you go, find out on your grind
a little bit still.
I'll talk about why in a second
but they can be a bit drippy
and a bit of work sometimes.
There are other solutions which are sort
of manual pre-infusion solutions.
And that might be
situations where a machine
will allow you to open the water circuit
but not turn on the pump.
So typically the group
head solenoid will open,
water will flow onto the
coffee at line pressure.
That's whatever pressure your
tap water is coming out at.
That might be between one
and three bars of pressure.
You can do this until the first
droplets of liquid appear.
You can do it for a fixed amount of time.
That's kind of how it works.
And then you might flick
an additional switch
and your pump will come on
and you'll have that full pressure
for the duration of the shot hole
until you change it down
the line a little bit.
There is and I don't recommend using this
an additional option
which is called mechanical pre-infusion.
Here the machine turns on
the pump, pumps water in
shuts it off, waits a
little bit and pumps again.
That's quite disruptive because
if you built a new pressure
and you release it a little
bit like the end of a shot
that puck will break apart a little bit.
I'm just not a huge fan
of mechanical pre-infusion
where you have this kind
of disruptive effect
going on there.
And I suppose lastly, you've
got something like the decent.
We can't help, but talk about that machine
in this series where you can do all sorts
of crazy stuff in a automated way.
You can have these kind
of blooming pre-infusion
where you pump some water in
but you don't depressurize the system.
You just let it sort of
soak for 10, 20, 30 seconds
if you want to, and then bring
up kind of full pressure.
And this again, allows you to go finer,
and finer and finer.
And there's a number of
reasons that people speculate
the pre-infusion allows
you to grind finer,
I'll offer a couple.
First, the most common explanation is
about fine migration.
Here the idea is that the puck
has swollen up and trapped
all the little fine particles in place
and they can't really
move through the shot
during the extraction.
This prevents them all kind
of lining up around the holes
at the bottom and providing
a kind of sandbagging effect.
It's a reasonably good explanation.
And I think broadly it is true.
I think the other aspect of this is
that there is still extraction
happening in this phase.
And coffee very quickly, a
good amount of it is extracted.
And so if you have a
very long pre-infusion
you've kind of washed away
between probably eight and 10%
of your puck before you've
hit it with the full pressure.
So for me, that's the
other potential impact.
I'm sure there are other reasons.
It's still an area where we're exploring
and people are trying to
understand, but generally speaking
some pre-infusion is considered very good.
Repeatable pre-infusion will
make your life much easier
if you're trying to produce
repeatable espressos.
Now let's talk about the
kind of main brewing pressure
that you're going to work at.
Now, in a pump machine,
this would typically be a fixed pressure.
It might be nine bars, you
might've set it to 8.5.
You might set it to six, it's up to you.
But that's the kind of brewing pressure
that you're gonna work with.
The higher the pressure, as
we've talked about to a point
the finer you can grind.
The downside is at nine
bars, that water is
under huge pressure and
is looking for channels.
It's looking for shortcuts
through the coffee,
the higher the pressure
that you're working with
the more likely you are
to get channels forming.
If you say about six bars,
you might grind a bit coarser
which you think would decrease your yield,
decrease your extraction, but
you might have an improvement
in evenness allowing you to
have a better tasting shot.
And a higher extraction
than you would have done
at nine bars.
Typically lower end grinders
can often be quite clumpy.
And if you don't declump them thoroughly
as part of your prep process
those clumps can encourage
channeling a little bit more.
The reason people love old
school lever machines is that
as your shot progresses, your
pressure is decreasing, right?
So as you start to wash away
more and more of your puck,
it becomes more and more
susceptible to channeling
what actually you're dropping
the pressure alongside that
which decreases the
likelihood of channeling.
This is actually a really nice solution
and it works very well.
It's mechanical, it's
simple, it's repeatable.
The downside of a lever
machine is that it's work.
Now, there are purely
manual lever machines
things like the flair.
And what you'll find is as
you're pulling that lever
and trying to hit a pressure
towards the end of the shot
you'll find yourself pulling
or what feels like a consistent pressure
what feels like a normal natural movement
but that gauge is declining as well.
So I think that as you brew
that feels interesting
and kind of right to do.
There are other machines
like the Decent or others
that can do a sort of automated
to declining pressures.
And I think that's kind of useful.
And there are machines
that would allow you to
just step down your pressure
to something a bit lower on
the last half of your
shot or the last third
of your shot anyway.
Now we do still need to
talk about the world of flow
and how that impact
pressure a little bit more.
And we'll come to that in just a second.
And when do you need to talk
about some practical stuff
about how you might use pressure
or think about pressure, day to day.
Before we do that there is a little ad
from this video sponsor,
which is Skillshare.
Skillshare is an online learning community
full of thousands of classes
for creative and curious
people like you and me.
I love Skillshare
because it lets me indulge
all the different parts
of me that liked to learn or
like to develop new skills.
And I'll give you a couple of examples.
On the one hand, part of me
is really enjoying Thomas Frank's class
on productivity for creatives.
And I really like the idea that creativity
is a thing that you
practice, that you learn
that it's a muscle and
not amuse in his words.
On the other hand, my
interest in photography
has led me to Sarah Rafferty's class.
It's an introduction to cyanotypes
and using that technique
to create beautiful botanical prints.
I kind of want to make
one from coffee trees.
Now, Skillshare is a created
space just for learning.
So there's no ads on any of
the videos that you watch.
In addition for just $10 a month
with an annual subscription
you have access to every
single premium class.
And I think that is great value.

Thank you to Skillshare
for sponsoring this video.
So let's talk about flow.
This has become a kind of
new topic of conversation
that to some extent has replaced
the conversation around pressure.
And in puck, I think it's
because pressure is an input
into a brew recipe and flow isn't output
and measuring your output
and seeing your output
and understanding your output allows you
to make better inputs and
produce better tasting coffee.
And that's certainly what
we saw with the decent
when it kind of popped up onto the scene.
People began to see
for the first time
channels actually happening
without having to have
a naked portarfilter
or a little mirror under
your drip tray and sort
of looking up and seeing them
looking for little channels.
Instead, you could see that
for a constant pressure
your flow began to increase
towards the end of the shot
because there was simply
less resistance there.
And that increased very
quickly, that was bad news.
Now, the world of flow profiling
is not really locked in yet.
It's in the sort of development
phase still, but the idea
that a machine could dynamically
adjust its pressure based
on a variance of flow
is really interesting.
If my shot starts to channel,
the machine could in theory
just pull back on the
pressure a little bit.
So it doesn't explode
to that channel so much
and I have a more even extraction.
This is definitely an
interesting part of the future.
That isn't to say
everyone has to buy Decent
as that's the only machine
anyone should have.
I'm not saying that at all
it's a great machine for
the right kind of person
and a terrible machine for
the wrong kind of person.
That's true of most
coffee machines in a way.
But it's just interesting
that the conversation
around pressure is beginning to move
into something interestingly practical
that has real world implications.
I would say that, yeah, if
you have a naked portafilter
and you begin to see a
little bit of channeling
if your machine allows
a lower pressure phase
switching to that then, would
be better than living it
at a higher pressure.
I would say same with the manual machine,
if you're pulling really hard
and you see a little spritz
come out in a big channel
don't keep pulling as hard
back that pressure off
a little bit, right?
You're more likely to
have an even extraction
by reducing that pressure
out a little bit more.
Ultimately I think really
big variances and pressure
during the shot will produce
different tasting espresso
but rarely better espresso.
I think having small changes
to flow, preventing channeling
or extending pre-infusion to make sure
that the puck is entirely saturated.
Those are the big wins.
Those are the big returns
and brewing at a pressure
that matches the quality of your grinder,
its potential grind output
or matches your pug prep
skills is another good idea.
Nine bars is desirable
but it's playing on heart
and you can, you know
play on an easier mode by
reducing your pressure.
It's a compromise
but overall I'd say you'll
get a better espresso
but now I wanna hear from
you, which aspects of pressure
didn't we touch on here.
Are you doing something
with your pressure profiling routine
that's entirely different.
I'd love to hear from you
down in the comments below.
Now soon, this series will be returning
to a kind of dialing in where
I'll take a different grinder,
different machine, different coffee.
These will be chosen by
my patrian supporters.
And I dial it in and talk through
the whole kind of process.
I look forward to dialing in new coffees,
tasting new things,
experimenting with new machines.
And I hope you'll join me too.
But for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching.
I hope you have a great day.
