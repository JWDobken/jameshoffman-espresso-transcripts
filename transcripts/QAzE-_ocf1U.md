## Understanding Espresso - Brew Temperature (Episode #5)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAzE-_ocf1U>

Welcome to another episode
of understanding espresso,
and today we're going to be talking about
a kind of interesting topic
that is occasionally contentious
and that's brew temperature.
Now to begin with what
I want to do is give you
just kind of a brief history,
a brief overview of
how we've thought about
and talked about brew temperature
for espresso in the past.
For many people that goes
back to the old online groups
of alt.coffee where people got together
and began to talk about
the frustrations they had
with their domestic espresso machines
and the way that they sort
of set the temperature
for brewing.
They found that to be
inconsistent and frustrating
and so began to put PIDs on them.
Now, a PID is a certain type of controller
that can be applied for a
bunch of different stuff,
but here it was a way to
manage and maintain temperature
to improve the consistency
of their espresso.
This spread from places like alt.coffee
into the commercial world.
And one of the people that
was driving the conversation
about brew temperature very
early on was David Schomer.
His book was formative for
many people, including me,
and it really drove a
lot of the conversation
in the early days of what is
now kind of modern espresso.
He believed absolutely in the idea
of flat line temperature brewing,
that a machine should deliver
a constant temperature
of water from the beginning of the shot
to the end of the shot.
And he said this unlocked
levels of sweetness
in his espresso.
He really believed that it made it taste
much, much, much better, and maybe it did.
A lot about this is down
to personal preference
and we'll touch on that later on,
but he certainly drove the conversation.
For machine manufacturers
this was kind of great.
The problem of having
a machine just deliver
the same temperature of water
from the beginning of the shot
to the end, that's not a
complex engineering challenge,
and a number of manufacturers
rose to the occasion
and came up with great
solutions to do that thing.
The whole flat line
brewing thing was really
just a neat easy to communicate idea.
It's something you could test at home.
Did my machine deliver water at 93 Celsius
from beginning to end?
And what got lost a little bit at the time
was the idea of temperature profiling,
a natural curve to temperatures
because what I think
is much more important than
having a flatline profile
is having the same profile
time and time again.
And by having a flat profile,
that meant that chances are
it was flat every single
time you used the machine
and that was good, but it
doesn't necessarily mean
that having some variances is a bad thing
as long as that variance is
the same every single time.
That conversation is still
a little bit muddy out there
because there aren't many machines
that do temperature profiling on purpose.
Some of them will have a natural curve,
but I don't think there's
a ton of evidence around
on one curve being better than another.
An overall brew temperature,
I don't think it quite unlocks perfection
the way that we kind of hoped
it would back in the day.
We did hope that if we achieved
this perfectly flat temperature profile
that we would have this of
a leveling up of espresso
and that didn't happen,
but we got more consistent
equipment and that was good.
So today, when we talk about temperatures,
we'll talk about either I
guess a flatline profile
or your peak temperature
or sort of the temperature
that your curve we'll
spend the most time at.
If your machine does produce
a range of temperatures,
don't freak out as long
as it does the same thing
every time basically.
Now one thing we have to touch on again
is the idea that's now
called temperature surfing.
This is how you use your machine
to get it to act in a
more consistent manner.
There are generally two different outcomes
of temperature surfing through
the same kind of process.
By pulling water out of the group head
before you pull a shot,
you'll do one of two things.
In some machines you'll
pull out some very hot water
that's too hot to use and that
will cool the system down.
And if you time it right, you
can catch it as it comes up
to a kind of ideal temperature.
In other machines, you'll
actually heat up the group head
with the water flowing through it
and then have again your
desirable temperature afterwards.
There's tons of resource
online for particular machines
about temperature profiling routines.
I would check out some of
the forums like Home Barista,
Coffee Geek, and I'll leave
some links to those down below.
I can't tell you the perfect
temperature surfing routine
for your machine, because there
is simply too many machines,
but someone probably has worked it out
and they are sharing it in
those kind of communities.
So let's talk about temperature and taste,
because that's the thing we're
really interested in, right?
Like how does my temperature
impact the taste of my espresso
and therefore how should I use temperature
to improve the flavor of my espresso?
Now temperature works
in kind of a simple way
in that the hotter you go,
the more you are going to extract.
What I would say is
that it's very difficult
to make a decision about
changing temperature
based on only one or two espressos.
Temperature, unless it's
miles away from being correct,
is a kind of tweak, a small adjustment.
It'll help you clean up something
that you don't like about the espresso.
For example, if you have this consistent,
slight kind of unpleasant acidity
no matter what you've
done to change your ratio
or your recipe or your dose,
then that could be an opportunity
to increase your temperature
to increase your extraction
to kind of clean that up.
But if I just tasted one shot
and it was a little bit sour,
I'd look to something like ratio first
before just jumping
straight to temperature.
But if it's there time
and time and time again,
then that tells me that this coffee
might need a little bit more heat.
Similarly if no matter what I
do there's a little harshness,
a little bitterness to the espresso,
then I would potentially
drop the temperature
down a little bit.
It is a different kind of harshness
to say dirt in a machine,
which leaves a very lingering,
burned kind of bitter flavor here.
Generally overtemperature
espresso just is quite bitter
up front and a little bit
harsh and aggressive that way.
It's kind of rough edged to me.
It lacks a kind of clarity
and sort of smoothness to it.
And I know we're getting to
slightly pretentious language,
but you know it when you taste it.
Now generally, most of
the time we're brewing
in a couple of different ranges.
I would say you're
going to brew between 85
and 90 degrees Celsius for
darker, more developed roasts.
Between say 88 up to say 92
for kind of medium espresso style roasts.
And I would brew anywhere
from 90 all the way up to 95
for lighter espresso roasts.
Now those are pretty ballpark numbers,
but I also believe that typically
within that sort of window,
things should taste pretty good.
I know that some people had experiences
where they've adjusted the temperature
by half a degree Celsius and
had a good shot the next shot,
but they might've solved
a different problem
in that second espresso.
They might've pushed through
a little bit more liquid.
They may have had a slightly
different mix of coffee beans.
It's an organic thing,
it's grown on a farm.
It's not identical.
There's a number of different reasons
one espresso will be
different from the next one.
So you have to be careful
ascribing an improvement
to one particular change and
that's true of all espresso.
Generally I would make a change
of at least one degree Celsius
in order to expect a
noticeable change in flavor.
So if I was pulling shots at 92
and I was just wanting to improve things,
I would most likely go
to 94 other than 93,
but 93 would be the
smallest single change.
That one degree Celsius change
or around two degrees Fahrenheit.
Now many machines will
let you change it by less,
but I honestly don't think
that's a significant enough
change to fix the problem
that may have come from temperature.
And again, with darker roasts,
these lower temperatures
will prevent you extracting
too much in the way of bitterness,
in the way of harshness.
Whether it's filtered coffee or espresso,
there's a correlation.
The hotter your water, the
more you're going to extract.
And that can be a good thing
sometimes with lighter roasts
or that can be an unpleasant
and unbalancing thing
with darker roasts.
Now, there are a couple of weird outliers.
There are some interesting
ideas around profiling
that I want to talk about
and we do need to discuss
temperature and altitude,
but I've got a couple of
things to talk about first.
This video has a sponsor
which means it has a
coffee grinder giveaway.
I'm giving away five Baratza Encores
to people who desperately need
them and cannot afford them.
If you're in one of the 39 countries
that we can ship to on
warranty, then enter down below.
It's free to enter.
I'll pick five people and
send them a Baratza Encore.
If you can afford a
grinder, please buy local.
But if you can't, enter, I
wish you the best of luck.
And this is possible because this video

people like you and me.
Now in the past, I've used
Skillshare to help develop
my skills around creating videos
and there's tons of amazing
content there for that.
But I use it for a host
of other stuff too.
Like many of the people this year,
I've been paying a lot more attention
to the plants growing in my home
and trying to do a better job
filling my house with plants,
but I don't have natural green fingers.
I have been enjoying an amazing class
from Christopher Griffin.
He's got a great class
about plants at home
and I've learned a ton about
picking the right plant,
understanding my own space
and creating routines that
help keep those plants alive.

for sponsoring this video.
So up until this point,
it seemed pretty arbitrary, pretty simple.
Use your temperature to
extract more or less.
If you've got a dark roast,
extract a little bit less
to have more balanced shot,
but can it really just be that simple?
And for the most part,
I actually think it is.
Brew temperature is not something
I mess around with on the daily.
I'll typically start with a recommendation
from a roaster and see how
they're brewing their espresso
and that'll be my benchmark.
But beyond that,
I rarely really change brew temperature
to improve the taste of my espresso.
I'm using things like ratio
or using my initial dose.
They just have a bigger impact,
but here's a few little
things that I think
are kind of interesting
that are worth sharing.
Now firstly, this requires some level
of temperature profiling,
but it kind of blew my mind
when I learned about this.
I was once making espresso with a very,
very dark roast of coffee,
darker than I really wanted to drink
and I was struggling to
get the best out of it.
Now this was using machines
that had a brew boiler
and a group head that you could control it
as your temperature independently.
And in doing this, you could
create a temperature profile,
and here with very dark roasted espresso
I had very good results
starting with a kind
of hotter initial brew
and cooling it down in
the sort of second, third,
and final stage of the espresso.
On the T3 unit I was using
on a Black Eagle espresso machine,
I had the brew boiler running
at 105 degrees Celsius.
It's pressurized so it can still be liquid
at that temperature,
but my group head was running
down at 80 degrees Celsius.
Now the initial liquid that
goes from the brew boiler
to the group head flows quite quickly
and so didn't lose too much temperature.
It meant the start of my
espresso was actually pretty hot,
but by the time that the flow had slowed,
that hot water was spending
more time in contact
with a big thermal mass of cooler metal.
That meant that we have
this cooler profile
in the second two thirds.
This meant that my extraction at the start
was actually pretty good,
but by reducing the
temperature in the second half,
or second to two thirds, it
seemed to reduce the bitterness.
So you ended up with
an interesting textured
complex espresso for a very dark roast
without this overwhelming bitterness.
By having the whole profile
set at a lower temperature,
it wasn't bad, it just got a bit boring.
And this hotter start just
made for a more interesting,
delicious espresso.
Running a brew boiler
at 105 degrees Celsius,
it seemed totally at odds
with everything I knew
about brewing dark roast for espresso,
but the results were super interesting.
If you want to try it,
if you have a machine that can produce
some sort of temperature profiles.
Talking about brewing
at lower temperatures,
I will say pulling shots
at 80 degrees Celsius
is kind of a head wrecker.
Think of it in a way as the
cold brew of espresso brewing.
Now you're not cold brewing,
but you have a similar kind of thing.
You end up with this
very pleasant textured,
very kind of low acidity round,
desperately dull espresso.
But it broke my head,
the idea that once I dropped
below a certain temperature,
I just couldn't really
extract a bunch of the acids
that were quite unpleasant
if you've got a little bit of them.
If you brewed that same
coffee at 85 to 90,
it would be overwhelmingly sour,
but that actually dropped
away at 80 degrees Celsius.
It's not the most interesting
espresso of your life,
but if you have a machine that can do it,
it's definitely an
interesting little experience.
Don't expect the same level of creamer,
don't expect the same intensity,
but the texture is
generally very enjoyable.
Now one last one to talk about is altitude
and espresso brewing temperatures.
A lot of people know
that the higher up you go
in terms of altitude,
the lower the temperature
that water boils at.
And if you're brewing at 93
degrees Celsius in a place
where water boils at 93 degrees Celsius,
is that a massive issue?
And the answer actually is no,
because when you're brewing espresso,
that environment is actually
sealed and pressurized.
When you're brewing at nine bars,
water cannot boil at that
temperature at 93 degrees Celsius.
It's too pressurized to do so.
It's only at very low
pressures that it can boil
below a hundred degrees Celsius.
So when you're brewing your
espresso, there are no issues.
You can keep brewing at 93, 94, 95, 96,
even though your water may
boil at cooler temperatures.
One thing that will happen though is that
as your your espresso
liquid leaves the basket
and leaves this pressurized environment,
that lower pressure tends
to cause much bigger,
foamier looking creamer.
And if you're pulling
shots without scales,
it's really hard to assess
how much liquid you've got
cause you just have this
much fluffier espresso.
So all I would say is
that pulling shots by eye
and at high altitude is
incredibly difficult.
Expect your creamer to
to sort of be less stable
because these bubbles are
bigger and less stable,
but if you hit your ratios
it should taste completely delicious.
A lot of people worked this out
when the World Barista
Championships were in Bogata
and everyone was brewing on scales
because their shots just looked too weird
because of the altitude.
That was really interesting.
But now I'll hand it over to you.
I'd love to hear your
thoughts on brew temperature.
Do you mess with it a lot?
Do you find that small tweaks
actually yield big results
in contrast to what I experienced?
I would love to hear from you
down in the comments below,
but for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching
and I hope you have a great day.
