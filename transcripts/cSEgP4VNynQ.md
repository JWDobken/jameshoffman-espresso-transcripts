## How To Cup (Taste) Coffee At Home

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSEgP4VNynQ>

Hi there, today we're gonna talk about
how to set up a coffee cupping at home.
Now a coffee cupping is a
specific sort of coffee tasting,
used really commonly
in the coffee industry,
at all sections of the value chain.
It really refers to a specific way
of brewing as well as tasting,
and we're not gonna try
and replicate all of it,
we're gonna cherry pick the best bits,
so that we can put on
a really simple cupping
and do comparative tasting.
And that's really the key.
The key to developing your sense of taste,
is to taste different
coffees side by side,
and this is the easiest way to do that.
The coffee industry uses cupping
in a host of different ways.
A buyer will cup coffees at origin
when looking for different lots
that they might want to purchase.
An importer may cup
coffees to make sure that
what arrived matches the pre-ship sample.
A roaster make-up coffees
is part of their quality control process,
to make sure that their
roasting has been up to scratch,
and a cafe make-up coffees
to decide which coffees
they wanna put on their menu.
Now, as I said, there are a
ton of protocols and rituals
around cupping in the industry.
We don't need to replicate all of those.
We're gonna take the most important bits
to get to a nice comparative cupping.
So in this video, I'll walk you through
what you need in terms of equipment,
and I think you'll have
most of it at home already.
I'll walk you through the brewing process,
how we're gonna brew coffee in a cupping,
and then I'll walk you
through the basic steps
of how to cup several coffee side-by-side.
This is gonna be a two-part video.
This is really the practicalities
of setting up a coffee tasting at home,
what you need and how to do it.
The second part is gonna
be about taste itself,
acidity, sweetness,
exploring those things,
diving in, in much more detail.
But this one, this part is just
the practicalities of getting set up.
So the first thing you're
gonna need is a kettle.
It doesn't matter whether
it's a expensive kettle,
cheap kettle, it doesn't have
to be a gooseneck kettle,
just a regular domestic
kettle is completely fine.
Make sure you fill this
with fresh cold water,
that's nice and soft
and is good at tasting,
that's important too.
Next thing you're gonna
need is a weighing scale,
and you want to be weighing
both coffee and water with it,
so something accurate to
.1 of a gram is ideal.
And then you're gonna
need a coffee grinder.
Now in our ideal world you want a grinder
that's designed to grind through
everything that you put in it,
that doesn't really retain any coffee.
If you have a grinder
that does retain coffee,
and you've got a hand
grinder in this situation,
a hand grinder might be better.
And then you need some sort of spoons.
Now it can be something
like a coffee cupping spoon,
these are designed for coffee cupping,
but that's not actually that necessary,
it's perfectly good to just use
a dessert spoon or a soup spoon.
And if you want to, you could
do something really fancy,
but that's not a requirement,
you just need something
of this kind of size,
and you need a few of them.
And then we need something to brew in.
Now the industry uses these,
they're called cupping bowls.
It's nothing special, it's nothing fancy,
it's basically a sugar bowl.
It's a bowl of about 250
mils in volume and that's it.
You don't need to use something like this,
but if you've got a bunch of
these or something like it,
then that's great, but you can use
a heat proof glass if you want to,
lots of people like to use that,
but if you have neither of those things,
then you can brew in just a regular mug.
That's fine and it can
even be a pretty big mug,
but you'll have to make some changes
and adapt your recipe
a little bit as you go.
But all you need is ideally five or six
of roughly the same size things,
and to know how big they are.
And then the last thing
you need, is some coffee.
Now I have to be clear here,
what you don't have to do is this,
you don't have to go
and buy three full bags,
four, five, six full bags
of different coffees.
You can get away with getting hold of say
20 grams of one particular coffee,
and that's enough for you to cup with it.
Now, the ideal number I would
say if you're starting out,
is maybe four or five.
I wouldn't try and get hold
of 10 different samples
if you're just getting used
to kind of cupping coffee side by side.
Three is enough, two is enough
actually to have some
interesting learning,
but I think four or
five is really the best.
Just do what you need to do
to get four or five little
samples of coffee to taste,
go and talk to your local coffee shop,
a lot of them are pretty
interested in talking to you
if you're enthusiastic
about tasting coffee,
and you only want a few
grams to do it with.
If you've got friends
that buy a good coffee,
trade with them, there's loads
of different ways to do it,
but all you need is a little
bit of a few different things.
That's really the key.
So let's talk about how
you're gonna brew coffee
for your coffee cupping,
and if you've seen my French
Press technique video,
a lot of this is gonna be
very very very familiar.
Now there's two ideas behind the way
that we brew coffee in a cupping.
One, it's the way to brew coffee
that has the least human
interaction, right?
What we don't wanna do is brew coffee
in a way where our
technique can impact taste.
Pour-over is a great, but
how you brew a pour-over
can make it sweeter or more acidic.
So at what point are you
tasting the pour-over?
And at what point are
you tasting the coffee?
The other big idea behind this
whole thing is scalability.
To brew five pour-overs would
not only be time-consuming,
it would be really annoying,
let alone trying to do 10 or 20.
This is a way that we can brew
several coffees at the same time,
and it's really really really easy.
So what's the method?
Well, it couldn't be simpler.
We're gonna grind some coffee,
kind of in the finer end of medium fine,
and we're gonna pour some hot water on it
and let it steep for about four minutes,
just like a French Press.
Then there'll be a crust
that forms on the top,
and we'll stir it after four minutes,
clean off anything that's left floating,
and then we have a bowl of coffee
or a mug of coffee or a glass
of coffee, ready to taste.
So the key things here
are recipe and ratio.
Now I'm gonna recommend a
ratio of 60 grams per liter.
Now, usually for an
infusion brew like this,
I would recommend 75 grams a liter,
but here brewing a little weaker
actually makes the tasting
process a little bit easier.
And then you've got recipe, right?
So if you've got, say a 240, 250 mil bowl,
you don't wanna use
240, 250 mils of water.
You wanna use 200 and that
would be 12 grams of coffee,
and when you brew that 12
grams of coffee, it'll bloom.
A foam will appear and
it will swell up in size.
That volume is typically
three times to four times
the weight of the coffee.
And it'll vary a little bit.
So that 12 grams will
easily take up 40 mils,
plus the 200 equals a very
full bowl in a 240 mils bowl.
If you don't have five
or six cups or bowls
that are the same size
and shape, that's okay,
you can use a whole bunch of
different sizes if you want to.
You've got two choices,
either pick the smallest size,
this case 10 grams to 160 and
do that in all the vessels,
or you could scale up and down.
This is pretty much twice the size,
so I do 20 grams to
about 330 grams of water.
Choice is yours,
whatever's easier for you.
Now when it comes time to weigh beans,
weigh them into the vessel
you're gonna be brewing in later,
it's just an easy way
to keep them organized
as you prep up.
I would say you wanna be accurate
to ideally your target weight,
give or take 0.1 of a gram.
So if I want 12 grams in here,
it's 11.9 to 12.1 is my kind of window.
Once you grind them, weigh them again,
because you might've lost a little bit
of coffee to that grinder.
In addition, before you
grind your main tasting
sample of a particular coffee,
grind through just a
little handful of beans,
just to make sure that
there's nothing left
from a previous coffee in that grinder,
once that's done, once you've weighed out
all your beans, hide the bags.
What you don't want is kind of prompts
or tastes notes lying around,
influencing you when you taste.
So make a note of what's
what, get rid of them.
For the sake of this tasting,
I'm just gonna set up
three different coffees in
three very different vessels,
I'm gonna need a couple
of spare empty vessels
that I'll use for rinsing and cleaning,
and I'll be good to go.
So right now I'm gonna
prep my three samples,
and then I'm gonna boil a kettle,
and when I come back, we'll
start the tasting process.

Our water is boiled
and we are ready to go.
Now, if you go to an industry tasting,
you'll notice that people are
often already taking notes
on things like the smell
of the dry grounds.
There are gonna be opportunities
to smell the coffee before we taste it
and that's interesting,
but if you're new to coffee
tasting this isn't a taste,
if it's fun, that's good, if
it's interesting that's good,
but you don't have to take copious notes,
you don't have to find dozens
of words to describe things.
Don't worry about it.
Let's get into brewing.
Now I'm gonna brew on scales
because I'm brewing
three different recipes
here I've got 12 grams, 15 and 20,
and I'll need to brew the
right weights accordingly.
And it's really hard to brew
consistently without scales,
even in the same bowls with
the same weight of coffee,
some coffees brew more than others.
So zero without, add your hot water,
lovely.
These are a little bit hot.
And this is now perfect time to use
the mostly useless digital assistant
in your pocket in your phone,
set a timer for four minutes.
Okay, your timer is set for four minutes.
At the end of four minutes,
we're gonna get a spoon,
and we're gonna use it to
stop the brewing process.
We're gonna gently stir the
crust on top three times,
and that's gonna cause
most of the grounds to sink to the bottom.
You're then gonna get a second spoon,
to scrape off anything on the
top that's still floating,
leaving a clean bowl, ready to taste.
Now again, in the industry
you'll notice people
smelling really intently,
when they're stirring that crust.
It's an interesting aroma release moment,
but if you're new to coffee tasting,
don't worry about it too much.
It's fun, and it's interesting,
but don't obsess over
these kind of details.
The coffee industry has a
bunch of other priorities
around a tasting, than we do at home.
And so now these are
nearly ready to taste,
they're just a little bit too hot.
I would recommend waiting
at least 10 more minutes
to let them cool down.
Right now they're not only so hot
that they'd burn your tongue,
but they're almost impossible to taste
when they're that hot.
Tasting gets easier
the cooler coffee gets.
Use time to get rid of that rinse water,
clean up the space and get ready to cup.
Go and grab that notebook,
drink a glass of water and get ready.
And so now finally, it's time to taste.
So the spoon, the spoon is there
so that we can just have
a little sample of coffee,
and not have to pick up a
mug of hot liquid, that's it.
It lets us do one more thing,
which is slip the coffee.
Now you'll see coffee professionals
make an astonishing array of
bizarre noises as they slip.
This is mostly to cover our insecurities
and make us look like we
know what we're doing.
Really, you need a
little sample of liquid,
and just generally, you're really
just trying to gently spray
the coffee into your mouth.
It's just kind of turning up the volume
on the flavors that you're tasting.
Give you a spoon a little
rinse between bowls,
and keep tasting, compare and contrast,
that's the game here.
Make sure you keep tasting
from hot all the way down
to kind of room temperature.
The coffees are gonna
change so much in that time,
and they'll just get
easier and easier to taste.
So like I said, in a couple of weeks,
there'll be another part of this,
which is much more focused on
exploring your sense of
taste through coffee,
this is really just about
the practical process
of setting up and doing
a coffee cupping at home.
And what I want you to do
is to go and try doing this,
set something up, give it a
go taste, compare, contrast.
Don't overthink it.
Just thinking about what you
like, what you don't like.
When you're familiar with the process,
then we'll go deeper
on your sense of taste
and developing your palate for coffee.
I'd love your feedback
down in the comments below,
did you try this?
Have you run a cupping at home?
Did you come up with some problems?
Did you have a good time?
Did you enjoy it?
Was it fun?
Was it easy?
Let me know your thoughts, I wanna hear.
As always, thank you so much for watching,
hope you have a great day.
