## The Smart Espresso Profiler Review

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckBWoRHkUZ4>

This is the Smart Espresso Profiler.
This is a very interesting little device,
but it's actually not
just a hardware thing,
it's a hardware and software thing.
Let me explain.
This in my hand is a
digital pressure transducer,
that is Bluetooth enabled.
That means it could send
the pressure it was sensing
to something like, I
don't know, a smartphone.
With the right software, you
could read to that pressure
and maybe do something cool with it.
Let me give you some
context as to how this works
when it comes to espresso.
So this I think is the brainchild
of a guy called Gabor Laczko.
He is a coffee roaster,
he is a video maker,
he's made some very cool
stuff, I'll link down below,
and he's also a lever head.
He loves lever espresso machines.
He wanted to have a way of tracking
what was going on when
you're pulling a shot,
but it's not just Gabor,
there's another person involved as well.
One of Gabor's customers,
a guy called Miklos Csanady,
he's a software guy,
and he got involved to
write the software piece
to go with the hardware.
The idea is this:
you can attach this thing
to anything that generates pressure
and you can connect it to your telephone.
And at the same time, you
can connect your phone
to, say, an Acaia Pearl set of scales.
And at this point, you could monitor,
and potentially replicate,
what you're doing in a lever espresso.
There are two types of lever machines.
There is the classic kind of spring type
where pulling the lever
down compresses the spring,
and when you let go,
the expansion of that spring
generates the pressure.
And then there's the second
type of lever machine
which is a much more direct thing
where you pulling down on the lever
actually generates the pressure.
These are the kinds of
things we've seen before
like the Flair or the ROK or the Robot.
These are all direct pressure
manual lever machines
and they're cool and they're fun,
but it's difficult to
really know what's going on.
Even if you've got a gauge to
be accurate and repeatable,
that's really tough.
Now, humans are good at some things
and we're good at having fun making coffee
but we're pretty terrible at
pulling levers repeatedly.
This might just be a
solution to that problem.
In order to explain it and demonstrate it,
I'm going to need to make some coffee
and I'm going to need a
coffee machine to make it on.
So let's grab one.
What I have here is an Olympia Cremina.
These are very cool little
direct lever machines.
They're a little bit
culty, they're very cool,
they're very beautiful as you can see.
Now, Gabor very kindly
modified this one for me
so that I could use the Smart
Espresso Profiler with it.
Now there is going to be a
review of this machine coming.
It is going to be given away
at the end of it, as always.
Thank you to all the
Patreon backers I have
that allow me to go and buy
this, review it honestly,
and then give it away.
These will actually be given away together
because obviously this has
been modified to work with this
and it only seems fair that
they go to a home together.
Very simple, this just kind of screws in.
And now we can turn
this on and get it hot.
We are on, we're ready to
go, the machine is hot.
It is time for us to pull some espresso.
To do that, to use this thing,
we've got to use our phone.
So there's an app, it's a
very nice app, if I'm honest,
it's called the SE Profiler app.
You can download it if you want
to have a little look around.
This is the main screen for it.
And to get going, you would swipe,
and then open up devices
and make sure you were connected
to your pressure transducer
and also to your Acaia.
I think at the moment only the Acaia Lunar
I think is supported.
It's a good little scale,
it's expensive though,
but this is about the best anyway.
So here is your setup screen
for what you're going to do.
Right now, it's a blank template
because right now I have
no target profile set,
but I can record one.
So the first thing that we're going to do
is we're going to get some coffee.
Now, this little thing,
doesn't take a sort of huge dose.
We're going to use 14 grams in here
and I'm going to get 14
grams of ground coffee.
And when you put your dose on
the scale, and it says 14.1,
in the app, I can set
that as my starting dose.
How very nice.
So let's get ready to brew.
Now, this is not going
to be a perfect shot
because I just want to talk
you through how the app works.
So I don't really care how this goes,
but it'll be interesting.
So, scale,
cup,
zero.
Now, when I hit start,
it will start logging
both the weight here and
the pressure at the sensor.
Let's begin.
Now with this machine,
when you lift the lever,
we're going to get a little
pressure reading here.
Now, as soon as I start to push down,
you can see the pressure climb.
Now a seated position is
not the easiest position
to produce a decent, you know, leverage,
but here, you know, six
bars I'm doing okay.
And I can choose to gently ramp that down.
I can see the mass in the cup climbing up,
climbing up, climbing up,
and I can see my brew ratio.
I've hit the end there.
Let the pressure dissipate naturally.
And lo and behold, once
it stops, I can hit stop.
And there I have a profile.
And I can see my brew time,
I can see my pre-infusion,
I can see my mass in the cup,
I can see my brew pressure.
Now, if this just so happened to be
the best espresso of my life,
which is, well I'm not going say likely,
but it's not unlikely,
it's not impossible,
but let's say it is, well, I
can save this profile, right?
And I can look at my
history and come in here
and I can set, as a reference.
This means if I want to
replicate this exact shot,
I would need the same
grind, the same dose,
all that kind of stuff.
But I've got a template to work with.
Should we see if I can do
exactly the same thing again
just for a bit of fun?
So if I'm honest, that
was not the greatest shot,
but that's not the point right now.
Let's go, let's replicate this thing.
Here we go.
Oh, I went early.
Now the grind is just too
course here, actually.
But I can sort of reasonably accurately.
Let's see if I can tail
that down at the same time.
And you can see my mass in the cup
is trailing a little bit,
but it's going to end up
ultimately at the same weight,
and surprisingly.
There we go.
So you can see my attempt, very quickly,
at replicating a curve.
Now, I'm not giving myself excuses,
but it's not the easiest
thing to do sitting down
but that's not really the point.
The point is I have,
beautifully and simply,
a lot of information about
what's going on here.
And that's really useful,
that's really interesting.
It makes this thing that is
a little bit of a dark art,
you know, how to really
pull repeatable shots
on a direct pressure lever machine.
Well, it kind of opens that up.
It makes it entirely possible.
And what's more interesting
is that I could put this
same thing onto a Flair,
and I could pull a shot on this thing,
and then I could go and
replicate, as closely as possible,
the same pressures, the
same mass in the cup,
therefore the same kind of grind setting,
on a whole other machine.
Now it was actually John
from Decent Espresso
that put me on to them in the first place.
And I think in future, there's
going to be an integration
between Decent Espresso
machines and the SEP.
I think the SEP software
will ship on Decent tablets,
but watch this space.
I'm not going to say too much,
but the possibilities get pretty exciting
if you're interested in messing around
with the way that pressure and flow
and all that stuff interact
inside one of these machines.
Previously, I have made videos covering
the software that goes with smart scales
and I was not complimentary
because it was all awful.
It brings me a great deal
of pleasure to use an app
that is intuitive and beautiful,
simple, presents all
the information I need.
I think this is a really well done app.
I think they've done a fantastic job
and they had to, really,
because this setup is expensive.
I think it's about $400.
That is not a small amount of money.
That's expensive, but if
you've got one of these,
if you spend a few thousand
on something like this,
well, for a small price in comparison,
you get a whole new level of
insight into what is going on
and a whole set of tools
around how to brew better espresso.
Now, while the app is very
simple, very intuitive,
if you want to make it a more
detailed logging experience,
you can certainly do that.
And you can start to log
quite a lot of information
about a roastery, about
the beans, roasting date,
description, color, operator.
All of this stuff is there
if you want to get super, super nerdy.
If you really want to
track all of this stuff,
that's very easy to do.
Now, for me, I don't
want to log every detail.
I'm happy with my weight in, weight out,
brew time, brew pressures.
If I want to set something
as a reference curve,
that's enough for me, I
don't want to go crazy.
But if you want it, it's absolutely there.
So overall, I really like the app.
I think having pressure to
0.01 of a bar with low latency
is kind of amazing.
I think the detail is
wonderfully presented.
I think they've done a
really, a really good job.
So overall I'm pretty impressed.
I think it's pretty fantastic.
I will say that I probably
have a little bias in this
because Gabor has been so helpful
with everything from the beginning.
And, you know, I kind
of encountered his stuff
before I really understood that he built
the original pressure gauge
for the Flair in my old review,
but I just didn't really
understand that connection
and I messed that up quite badly,
so apologies, very delayed apologies,
but apologies for getting that so wrong.
It's expensive, it's really well-made.
Changing the battery on it is very simple.
That's the only maintenance
you would need to do to it.
Installation on many things
will be relatively easy.
I think this is a great tool.
I imagine myself, I see myself using this
in a host of different
applications and having some fun.
And Gabor does cool stuff.
And I would like to do some cool stuff
with him in the future, so maybe we will.
Watch this space.
Now, as I said, this is not a review
of this particular espresso machine.
That is coming, I'm working on that.
That will be after this,
and these things in combination,
this Profiler, this
machine will be given away
to somebody somewhere in the world
who can use 230 volt power.
And that will make me happy,
but that's a future review.
So once again, thank you to Patreons
for supporting this channel,
for giving me a budget
to go and buy this stuff,
and give you honest reviews.
It's cool what you can do with it.
I think there are a
lot of users out there.
If you are making manual
espresso like this, in any form,
I think it's worth considering
if you want to dive deeper
and understand more
about what you're doing.
It's expensive, I get that,
but it's a small run,
it's a small company,
and I think they're doing something cool.
It is nice to see tech in
coffee be really well-executed.
But I'd like to hear your thoughts.
Do you have one?
Is anyone watching who's got
one of these things, too?
Do you use it all the time?
Do you love it?
What kind of things have
you learned from it?
Is there something you didn't see me do?
Is there something you want
me to show off about this?
Let me know if there's
something really interesting,
I'll probably throw it up
on Instagram at some point,
so follow me there,
there's a link in the
description down below.
But for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching,
and I hope you have a great day.
