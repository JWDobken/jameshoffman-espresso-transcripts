## A Rant: Espresso Ratios & Recipes

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Ja8pJU73s>

Today, we're gonna have
a little bit of a rant
about espresso ratios
and espresso recipes.
And the increasing
confusion between the two
and some of the problems
with those things.
So let's start with ratios.
Ratios refer to the ratio of ground coffee
at the start of your dose.
Let's say you brew with 18 grams
to the liquid weight of espresso.
So let's say 36 grams of
liquid espresso in the cup.
So that's a two to one ratio.
Brewing ratios go back to maybe
I think around 2007, there
was a load of work done
on the Homeroaster forum.
Particular shout out to
Andy Schechter for producing
some of the first kind of tables
that kind of codified espresso ratios.
A couple of things happened.
One, it was around the time
we were starting to transition
from measuring espressos
volume to espressos weight.
And that really accelerated
once refractometers came
on the scene and we began
to really, really understand
the impact of the liquid weight in the cup
and how important maintaining
those ratios were.
But back then, it was just
kind of interesting way
to talk about espresso and
begin to communicate it.
I think I found the first photo I took
of weighing a shot and I
remember being kind of stunned
at the difference between
the volume and the weight
of that espresso.
It was a ton of crema
so it looked much bigger
than it weighed.
Now, this early work by
people like Andy Schechter
began to kind of describe more objectively
what a Ristretto was,
what an espresso was,
would a Lungo might be
and it was to do with
these kinds of ratios.
So a one to a one or a one to 1.5.
That was kind of a Ristretto.
A ratio of one to two was kind of espresso
and a ratio say one to
three was closer to a Lungo.
And that was useful because
it gave us some definitions.
But at the same time, ratios were kind of
just abstract, philosophical ideas.
And they were also kind of shortcuts
for descriptions of strength.
A Ristretto brewed well
at this ratios would be
maybe 13, 14%.
A Lungo, maybe six to 8%.
An espresso brewed well, maybe 10%.
And by that, I mean, 10% of that espresso
was dissolved solids.
90% of that espresso was still water.
What we've seen increasingly is roasters
begin to use ratios as
a way to communicate
how to brew their coffee.
And I know I've done it myself,
thinking about it more and more,
it's actually not particularly helpful.
If I say brew espresso to two to one,
I'm kind of just saying make espresso.
Don't make a Ristretto don't
make a Lungo, make an espresso.
And the implication is that 18
to 36 is really just the same
as 20 to 40 or 22 to 44.
And that isn't the case.
That isn't the case at all.
They should ideally have the same strength
if they've all extracted equally well
but in the real world,
that's, that's unlikely,
because in the real world
of espresso recipes,
there are a whole matrix
of things that go into
impacting what a good
recipe is going to be,
the size and quality of the basket
in your espresso machine is one.
The quality of your grinder is another.
The quality of your
brewing water is another.
The espresso machine itself.
Then let's get into the coffee,
the roast level, the
altitude that it was grown,
the density of it, the
post-harvest process.
All of these things impact how easy it is
to extract that coffee.
And so saying anywhere is fine.
Any recipe is fine as
long as it's two to one.
Well, that isn't really true because
if you take a light roast,
very high grown washed coffee,
and you have a cheap entry-level grinder
and a cheap entry-level espresso machine,
you don't want to be
putting 20 grams of coffee
into an 18 grand basket.
You will have a bad time.
And what we've failed
to do is give, I think,
better and better
guidance on starting dose
because that's really,
that's the easiest thing.
If I give you a starting dose,
you can work out ending weight.
Brewing times, by and
large, we're somewhere
in the 25 to 35 second region.
Unless you're doing weird
things with pre-infusion.
And so some guidance there is useful,
but actually this ratio,
this relationship between ground
coffee and liquid espresso
is really super important.
But ratios on their own are not enough.
They're not particularly useful.
You may as well say, "Hey,
here's our espresso blend.
Brew it at 10% strength."
Because by saying brew it one to two,
that's the same thing.
You've said the same thing.
And you've said seemingly lots
but also nothing at all,
nothing really super useful.
Now, as I said, I, I've
been guilty of this.
You know, it became very
easy to get wrapped up
in these super neat convenient recipes.
And I think that the other
thing we've really failed
to communicate is that
they are a starting point.
So you wanna start from a
realistic place from your setup.
And I would always say, go go lower dose.
Unless you need a lot of liquid espresso,
set yourself up for success by starting
with a lower dose of coffee.
Don't start at 20. Don't start at 18.
Maybe start at 16 grams, right?
Unless you need a lot of liquid
espresso for some reason,
let's say you're making a big milk drink.
Sure, you might wanna start
with a lot more ground coffee,
but if you, you just want a
really great tasting shot,
whether that's a thing 30 gram
or 32 grandmas, 34 gram shot,
that amount of liquid
variance doesn't matter
in terms of the drinking,
but the quality of
extraction absolutely matters
to the enjoyment, to the aftertaste,
to the just delightfulness
of that espresso.
Right.
So we're gonna start,
let's say at 16 grams,
start with 16 to 32, but that's,
that's our starting point.
And you have to accept that
your setup will need
some tweaking and tuning.
Your brew water, your
grinder, all of these things
mean you'll have to experiment.
And Barista Hustle have a
great chart for navigating,
when to go finer, when to go coarser,
I'll link to that down below.
I'm not gonna try and
reproduce their work.
That's super useful,
but I do just wanna say,
take a ratio with a pinch of salt.
Ratios are abstract, philosophical ideas
that they're perfect
because they're not real.
They're not the real world.
A recipe is the real world,
but a really prescriptive recipe
should also be questioned.
Recipes should be starting points.
You should understand why
the guidance is there.
I would always recommend
brewing lower doses
of very high grown coffees and
I would do low ground coffees
like a Great Estate Brazil,
you can dose that up
a little bit more and
probably enjoy the texture
that comes with those
kinds of coffees brewed
at a one to two or even maybe less.
Now I get that there is
an audience out there
that just wants a simple answer that has
bought the good coffee.
They've got the good setup.
Just give me, just give me the answer.
I've got limited amount of coffee,
I've got a limited amount of time,
get me to good quickly.
And I think by giving
really prescriptive answers,
we do them a disservice
and the coffee that we
roast and sell a disservice.
And I hate that there's no easy answer,
but there is no easy answer.
Before I wrap up, I will say that I will,
in the near future, shoot
a version of this video
that has to do with
how I actually go about
dialing in and creating
a recipe for a coffee.
I'll get someone to give me something
with very limited information
and I'll dial it in.
And I'll go through the steps
about what I'm thinking about,
the adjustments that I'm making,
why am I dropped my dose,
why am I changed my grind or increase
the amount of liquid in the cup?
I will go through all of
that, but to wrap it up,
to wrap it up simply,
if you're looking for guidance,
understand that not all
two ones are created equal
and just brewing at a two to one,
doesn't necessarily get you
where the roaster wants you to go.
And if you're a roaster
or a barista trainer
or someone communicating recipes,
understand how limited the information
you're really communicating,
even by giving
a really, really, really specific recipe,
let's say one to one to 2.255369,
that very specific, but also
not at all specific whatsoever.
So I think we can do better.
I think we can communicate better.
And I think that we're getting
as an industry, potentially
a little bit lazy with ratios.
And so that's why I wanted
to have just a little,
just a little rant about that today.
All right, I'm done.
Let me know what you think
in the comments below.
Let's have a little
conversation about this.
As always, thank you so much for watching.
I hope you have a great day.
