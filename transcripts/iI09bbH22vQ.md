## Stop Swirling Your Espresso

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI09bbH22vQ>

Today's video is
gonna be a little weird.
It's gonna get right down the rabbit hole
of espresso, into the
weird little details.
Here's the deal.
I think espresso tastes
way better when you mix it,
before you drink it.
And here's why.
When an espresso brews,
the first liquid out of those
spouts is incredibly thick,
it's incredibly dense.
That kind of sits at the
bottom of the espresso cup,
and as the brew progresses,
less and less dense liquid
is coming out and that layers on top
of the first very dense layer,
a bit like one of those
trashy layered cocktails
that thankfully, nobody makes anymore.
If you just sip an unmixed espresso,
that first sip will be mostly
the last part of the shot.
It'll be thinner, have less
texture, less sweetness
and you sip again, it
gets a little bit better,
then you sip again and maybe you finish it
and you get just the super
dense stuff at the start,
sweeter but also much,
much, much more acidic.
So you get three evolving, interesting
but ultimately unsatisfying
sips of your coffee.
Or mix it all together before you drink it
and that way every single sip
is balanced and delicious.
Now I see a lot of people
swirling their espresso
before they drink it,
to kind of mix it all together.
The problem is,
I don't think that works.
I think it's way better when you stir it,
over swirling it.
And to be honest, every
time I do a taste test,
I feel the same way.
But that's very subjective.
Maybe there's an objective
way to test my hypothesis,
and I think there is.
So here's what I did.
So firstly, I was curious
about the difference
between stirring and doing
nothing to an espresso.
So I pulled two shots, I left one alone,
stirred the other and I
then pulled two or three
mils of liquid from the very
top of the cup of each one
and I tested the strength.
And there was a huge
difference between the two,
massive.
The unstirred shot,
that top layer was about
8% strength,
the stirred shot was
closer to 10% strength,
like a massive difference
in strength there.
So then, having established
that mixing is a thing
that we should be doing,
I then pulled a lot more shots.
And each time I would take a pair,
I would swirl one and stir the other,
and do the same test where I pulled
that little bit of liquid
from the top of each cup,
I'd strain it and test it
with a Roth tactometer .
If swirling was as good as stirring,
then they should produce
very similar results
in terms of strength.
But that isn't what happened.
Every single time stirring,
that top layer was stronger
than in a swirled shot.
Implying that there was much
better mixing in that shot,
than the other.
There wasn't a huge
difference between the two,
and in the stirred shot
that might be a few tenths
of a percent stronger in that
very top layer then the other
but backing that up with taste,
there was a really noticeable difference.
So that's why having tested it,
I'm gonna say, don't bother
swirling your espresso,
get a spoon and stir it.
And if the cafe doesn't give you one,
well they should, ask for one.
It's gonna make your
espresso much more enjoyable.
There is two more things
I should talk about.
Firstly, swirling feels pretty fun.
But it goes wrong a lot.
You've done it, I've done it,
if you swirl your espresso,
you've made a mess too.
Usually at a moment when you're tryna look
particularly professional
and give it a swirl
and you just destroy the place.
Secondly, swirling is a
thing you see on wine,
and swirling wine is a good thing.
The shape of a wine glass
means when you swirl
that liquid, you volatilize
a bunch of aromas
and they get trapped in the
head space above the wine,
inside the glass.
That way when you smell the glass,
you get a really clear
picture of that wine.
With coffee, an espresso cup,
does no trapping of aromas.
If you swirl, you'll
send a bunch of aromatic
compounds volatile,
off into the room.
Gone forever.
Just gone.
You don't get to enjoy them,
you don't get to smell them really,
they're just kind of gone.
So there's no real benefit
to swirling over stirring.
Now at this point you
might be rolling your eyes
and thinking I have lost my mind.
Maybe, maybe,
but I like to enjoy my
espresso as much as possible
and I hope you do to.
And I'd be interested to see if you agree.
Go and do this experiment,
if you can pull two side by side shots,
swirl and stir.
Tell me which one you prefer.
If you're a cafe that
doesn't believe in teaspoons,
shame on you.
And finally, let me know
in the comments down below,
what were your results
and have I lost my mind?
Have I gone too far down the rabbit hole
that is espresso?
I'd love to hear your thoughts,
and as always, thank you
so much for watching.
I hope you have a great day.
