## Wilfa Uniform vs Niche Zero: One Year Later

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQiLVamJRdk>

welcome to something a little bit
different
now i'm not just talking about the new
set which we have here which we will i
promise grow into a little bit more
but i'm actually talking about doing a
one year on review of two grinders that
i use
almost every day now you have the wilfer
uniform this lives in my house
i use this to make filter coffee every
morning and then you've got the niche
zero
which has lived in the studio since i
reviewed it and i bought one
to keep here just to use every day now i
wanted to do a one-year-on review
because i think it's a good check
on my reviews did i catch everything the
first time around or have i discovered
new things a year later secondly i get a
lot of questions about these grinders am
i still using them have i discovered
anything new would i still
recommend them so we'll talk about each
one a little bit more going some of the
stuff that i like some of the stuff that
i
don't like how has their performance
changed or
not over the year more now that i've had
them
if i had one big complaint about this
grinder it would be focused on one part
of one part only which is
the scale on top of it it is
frustrating and unnecessary now i'm very
happy to say
that wilfred do make a version of this
grinder that does not have a scale in it
it just has a lid
and i'll give an example of why i find
it a bit fussy and frustrating let's say
i want to make a v60 in the morning so
take my scale off my grinder tear it out
put my beans on top
weigh them out pour the beans into here
however from a noise and other
perspective i'm going to put this back
on again
and then i'm going to grind it through
and then i'm going to take my lid off
again
put it back down and then i'm going to
put my coffee on top my v6d all of that
stuff i'm going to brew
and then when i'm done it's back on
again i get that maybe it's a convenient
place to store your scale you're not
putting it in a kitchen drawer it's not
out or anything like that but honestly i
just want a lid i just want a lid on a
regular scale and i want to leave the
scale where it is
i want to leave the lid where it is and
just open up put beans in
close it get on with my day the scale
isn't a great scale i think i flagged
this in the review the first time around
the lag is definitely a bit of a
frustration if you're
trying to dose quite accurately you'll
often overshoot and the little
rubber protection mat gotta say
it's it's not that useful i understand
protection is good
you can't put something like a clever
dripper on top of here because it's all
wonky and it kind of sits funny and
that's just
frustrating while it is the biggest
gripe like i said they do a version
that's cheaper that just has a lid and
not a scale so if you're thinking about
this grinder at the end of this
then i would probably recommend that one
over this model
i will say the black paint on this
hasn't been fantastic you can see
here at the bottom where the ground
catcher goes in some chipping i've
managed to scratch it off here a little
bit
on the bottom of the grounds bin you can
see just what the friction has rubbed
the paint off
so i don't really care about that
but if you do then i might not recommend
the all matte black version
for you actually while i have the
grounds catcher bin i was a bit
concerned
when i first got this that that static
would be an issue i tend to do is grind
leave it in there for 10 15 seconds
then give it a good shake before i
dispense and then i don't really have
static issues i will still occasionally
put a little droplet of water in amongst
the coffee
uh there's a little hack video up here
if you want to know about that if you
don't know about that
great little tip if static is a problem
for you so those are some grumbles some
complaints but i'm using it every day so
there must be things i like and yeah
there really are i like
the coffee it makes it's got a good size
set a flat burst in here
and i like the coffee it makes i'm only
using this to make filter coffee in the
morning i do not make
espresso at home i don't have an
espresso machine at home i don't have
space i don't have time i
frankly don't have the inclination for
that to be part of my early morning
routine
i just want to make a nice cup of filter
coffee and this does a great job at that
it does grind for espresso but we'll
talk about that a little bit more in a
second
last bonus feature thing that i do like
works really well for me
is that this does have an auto shut off
so you put your coffee beans in
turn it on when it's finished grinding
within a few seconds and it's not always
perfect but it will
always shut itself off for you but now
let's talk about the niche so this has
lived in the studio and it's appeared in
a lot of videos because it's been a
great
little grinder to have around that i can
use for filter coffee that i can use
really easily for espresso so the niche
is a more expensive grinder it's 500
pounds which is
nearly 200 pounds more expensive than
this one here and what do you get for
your extra money well you get a very
capable espresso grinder
really this is a very easy to use single
dose grinder
it's intuitive it's simple and actually
has very little in the way of waste or
attention those are things that make it
super easy to dial in super efficient
and great for studio usage or just for
home espresso usage it's not perfect
nothing's perfect and i'll
tell you right now that weirdly i kind
of miss the auto wall function from this
in this so i'll often
put coffee in start at grinding go and
do something else because i
try and multitask in my life when it
comes to making coffee and and then sort
of wonder what that funny noise in the
background is and why is it still going
and
i have to go and switch it off that's a
tiny gripe i have since
added to this the uh npd that the the
disc
you might see that in some videos that's
to prevent popcorning from the grinder
it works really well it actually slows
down the grinder in terms of its feed
now i think that actually improves
ground quality and there's a little
video up here if you want to watch it
about that whole thing the build of this
has felt solid
sturdy the paint job has been wonderful
i have no complaints i have not been
necessarily very kind
to this grinder it's been in and out of
backpacks there is a function on here
that i talked about which is the
calibration function
i understand that is potentially useful
i've never found it really super useful
for me because i'm never quite sure when
i'm actually all the very way at the end
and when i do go all the way to the end
that calibration definitely doesn't line
up with anything on here which makes me
feel like i've done something a little
bit wrong and maybe i've over tightened
it for that calibration moment so
i don't worry about it too much
generally the way i have it set up most
of my espresso happens between 20
and 30. i do still love the little
dosing cup it's great for dosing into a
portafilter on the condition that it's a
58mm portafilter i think they do make
some smaller
dosing cups for smaller portafilters but
for dosing into a v60 for dosing into
anything been really useful and i get
comments on almost
every video asking what is this where
can i buy it
it's part of the niche and i don't think
they sell them separately though they
probably could and maybe should but
maybe it's just one of the perks of
getting their grinders in terms of
last complaints before we make some
coffee i i do wish
that this had a bigger sort of funnel
section here that held more coffee
i'm often grinding larger doses for
stuff here for little experiments where
i might want to grind
more than 30 or 40 grams and very
quickly this thing gets overwhelmed
the capacity here is much much larger
the conical version here
are great for espresso they work really
well i do like flat burs for espresso
but i have no complaints about the
quality of grind i'm getting from this
some people have concerns
about the taste of conical burs at
coarser grind settings for things like
v60s
but for me i certainly haven't felt like
i'm compromising
on the transparency or flavour of the
coffees that i'm brewing so
let's make some coffee and we'll start
by just brewing a couple of e60s
side by side with very similar grind
settings from each one and
let's see how they taste so i've got a
v60 got a couple papers
got some coffee useful this is the
moment where these two grinders can work
together actually so i can
i can weigh on this into into this
how convenient so i'll brew a 15
to 250 in each one of these

into you and 15.3 into you
for the sake of interest let's have a
race
these are at the same grand setting
there we go we'll start with the welfare
now you can see i'm bringing on the
scales as desired but
the placement in order to see the screen
isn't great you end up with this sort of
hanging off the back
the fact that this has no timer built in
you'd have to use a phone
very frustrating that it's really just a
scale so all done we need to just reset
or
pour out a cup full
so just while these cups of coffee are
cooling down i do want to do a very
quick
sound level test i'm going to grind each
of them i've got a decibel meter on my
phone
it's not perfect but it'll give us a
good idea of
if one is much louder than the other
so almost identical no real difference
though the tone of it
may be a personal preference one of them
may bother your ears more than the other
we've got a decent mic running so you
should have a pretty good idea of how
they sound
so now time for the taste test these are
on paper
identical extractions identical
strengths the same coffee in the same
water in
they're the same brew so any differences
really are down to
the grind profile and let's see what
they taste like
tasty fully extracted rich
sweet clean definitely a noticeable
difference between the two
now you'll already be thinking this
isn't good science this should be blind
and
i i would agree but if i can't taste
huge differences here then they probably
aren't really there and i would say the
difference between them is present but
not
enormous these aren't matching
extractions the the
wilfer tastes a little bit
uh cleaner it's a little bit more linear
in a way it's not got the texture
as a cup of the niche which is
interesting so they're the same strength
but it doesn't quite have the same
texture
it is a touch sweeter for me uh i think
they're both
very delicious cups of coffee without
the a b test i certainly wouldn't be
having any
fomo about other grinders or about the
other grinder you do have a
kind of fuzzier cup profile here it's
sweet it's got nice texture
but it does not quite have the same
clarity of flavor
as this cup here this is just that
fraction sweeter fraction more clarity
but both are good
but in this case i would award the kind
of win from the flavor perspective
to the wilfer before we dial in some
espresso it's something else i want to
talk about and that is the world's
largest coffee tasting october
3rd we will be streaming a tasting and
you can buy a kit
and if you really can't afford to get
involved click
down below enter the competition i'll
pick 50 people anywhere in the world
that we can
send kits to and i'll send some kids
and i can do that because this video has
an ad for squarespace
now when it was time to build a website
for the world's largest coffee tasting
at
world's largest coffeetasting.com i
immediately just went to squarespace
i knew that very quickly very easily i
could take a template from the gallery
and i could begin to customize it and
it's so easy to do i took my photos i
took my words my information
and i built a website i could leave this
website up
for years every time we do a tasting i
can add to it but there's nothing to
patch
upgrade install or worry about i love
that part of squarespace knowing that my
site will look great

thank you to squarespace for sponsoring
this video so let's talk about espresso
quick set change got an espresso machine
here moved things around so
it should make life a little bit easier
so both grinders are pre-loaded with 18
and a half grams i'll start with the
wilfur
now i will say that i would probably
recommend using like a dosing funnel to
help dose into a portafilter from this
it's not very easy
you get a lot a lot of cling
at fine grinds to the inside and you
find yourself tapping and shaking
and working very hard
to try and get the grounds out but let's
pull the shot
it is a good looking shot filled in
really nicely no real signs of
channeling
so that is exactly on spec it's 39.2
grams out and 33 seconds
in that window that i described at the
start so let's get on
with the niche as a dosing experience
this is very different
and we're done beautiful painless easy
i'll distribute this a little bit more
i'm testing a tool at the moment that'll
be up in another video
but as a starting point that's quick
that's easy there's nothing
retained inside the little dosing cup
again very nice start to the shop
everything looks nice and even
another 33 second shot let's give them a
quick stir
neither had obvious defects in terms of
channeling or any issues like that
they both did speed up a little bit
towards the back end of the shot
okay
now what i'll i'll say is that the
difference in espresso is present but
it's
not so big that it would be a deciding
factor in which one of these grinders i
might pick to make espresso the welfare
has a bit more acidity in the cup but it
is
a pleasant acidity there is a little bit
of acidity in here that's not quite as
nice
but both feel very sweet now it's a
pretty light roast coffee so i'd expect
some acidity
the texture on the niche is superior
like it
feels really nice it's got lovely kind
of silky
very pleasant soft kind of mouth feel
really very enjoyable as an espresso
there's probably a touch more clarity
again
in the welfare but how you feel about
the acidity that goes with it
may be a thing now you could argue that
this isn't necessarily a fair test
and that what i should have done is
really just dial in
the wilfur to get the absolute best
possible shot i could
and then dial in the niche to do the
same thing for me i was just interested
in the kind of
shots they produce if they are aiming
for the same kind of recipe that would
give me some insight into their burst
set and that kind of stuff
what i will say is that dialing in the
wilfer
is no fun it can pull shots and if you
occasionally need shots
great i think if you were using this as
a daily espresso grinder you'd end up
incredibly frustrating just getting
coffee out of the dosing bin into a
portafilter
it is not an enjoyable experience and
and it feels like something that it
could do
rather than something that it's built to
do the niche in comparison
all round experience wise it's just way
better and that's just getting coffee
from the dosing cup into the portafilter
by the time you factor in the fineness
of adjustment which in here
is very fine it's easy to make small
changes
here these are big steps you kind of
have to get lucky
and hope that you land on the right kind
of grind for
the profile that you want and i got
relatively lucky here but the niche
just gives you a lot more control it's a
lot more
accurate in the adjustments that you
make and overall
for making espresso it makes delicious
espresso
but the process of making espresso is
very enjoyable so in summary
both i think are great grinders i enjoy
having both in my life
i don't want to change either of them
because they fit the way that i
brew coffee in the places that i brew
coffee if you just make filter coffee at
home
then i think the wilfer is a great
grinder it's easy to use
it's certainly got enough control in
terms of grind settings the auto off is
a nice feature
it looks good on your kitchen surface
and the coffee's great
so i would recommend it for that purpose
but if you are meaningfully brewing
espresso if you're regularly brewing
espresso
then i would probably say don't buy this
grinder it's
not for you the niche i really like and
it's going nowhere it is
reliable it's easy to use it's easy to
clean would i like a flat
version of the niche yeah i'd be super
interested would i like it to have a
little auto off function
yeah that would be convenient but i
think for the money for 500 pounds
i'm not sure what else i would recommend
that has the versatility
of this and the kind of user experience
of this and the cup quality
of this i think it's a very good grinder
and one last thing before i wrap
up it's that my company does stock their
willfully uniform online i'm not gonna
leave a link to it
in the description i'll leave a link to
wilford's website if you want to know
more but now
i pass it off to you do you have either
of these grinders have you thought about
getting both like me it seems unlikely
but maybe you have have you had issues
that i haven't touched on have you had
things go wrong or go right
are you happy with your purchase i would
love to hear from you
down in the comments below but for now
i'll say thank you so much for watching
and hope you have a great day
