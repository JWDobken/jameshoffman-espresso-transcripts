## ZPM: The Kickstarter Failure That Revolutionised Espresso

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKA2COJRt6M>

Today, we're gonna talk about this,
the ZPM Nocturn.
Now, this was a Kickstarter project,
it had 1,500 backers
and not a single unit was delivered.
Now, I didn't think it existed,
but it turns out one of
my Patreon supporters
had one of the beta-testing units,
and he got in touch and
said, "Did I want to buy it?"
And yes, yes I did.
Now, the story of ZPM is interesting,
but what's more interesting to me
is that you can draw a line
from the failure of ZPM
through to the creation of
what I think is probably the most
influential espresso
machines in the last decade,
a machine that's kind of revolutionized
our understanding of espresso,
the Decent DE1.
Now before you ask, yes, it does work,
and yes, we are gonna make
some espresso with it.
But let me give you the backstory on ZPM.
The Kickstarter campaign launched
back on December 11th, 2011,
and this was back in the day
when videos were kind of charming
and not necessarily big budget affairs.
Their plan was to use a bunch
of off-the-shelf components
combined with a couple of
their own bespoke pieces,
I think their own thermoblock
design and group head design,
to create a very technically
capable espresso machine
that was very, very cheap.
Their proposed pricing
for Kickstarter was $200
for this unit,
which was a ridiculous price.
Now, the planned retail would be $400,
but either way,
for the kind of features
they were offering,
this was a very, very
compelling proposition.
When the Kickstarter finally closed,
they had raised $370,000.
Now in, in terms of modern Kickstarters,
that's not that much money,
but at the time
this was the sixth
highest funded Kickstarter
in its history.
Turns out their pricing
was perhaps not sustainable.
Something we do talk about on this channel
is the challenge of
manufacturers scaling up
what they're doing,
and I think people often
underestimate how difficult it is
to go from
some kind of fully functional prototypes,
which is essentially what this is,
through to mass manufacturing
thousands of units.
I don't think they had
the skill necessarily,
I don't think they had the
money necessarily to do it.
Now, I'm not trying to
pick over the bones of it,
I just think they were
very passionate founders
who were perhaps in
way over their heads.
The project didn't fail quickly.
In fact, it was October, 2015,
nearly four years after launching,
that they posted their
final update to Kickstarter.
And when they had shared the fact
that the company had ultimately failed
and they would not be shipping units,
the response from their customer base,
from their community, was angry.
So angry in fact,
that it generated enough
interest for the New York Times
to come and write a piece
about ZPM and its community.
Now, if you read the article
and it is linked in the
description down below,
towards the end of the piece,
you were introduced to a new
character in all of this,
that of John Buckman.
Now John, you may know as the founder,
the creator of the
Decent Espresso machine.
And in the piece,
he's in talks with ZPM
to kind of buy the
remnants of the company.
Seeing as John is in London right now,
I thought I would just
go and ask him in person
about how his interactions
and experience with ZPM
maybe influenced his creation
of the DE1.

- So firstly, I saw the ZPM video
  and I felt like
  it was gonna be quite
  hard for me to figure out
  how to make espresso,
  'cause I had no guide.
  And when I saw this video
  of these two nerdy guys
  and they were both technologists,
  and I'm a technologist,
  and I thought
  "I'm gonna trust them to be
  my guides into espresso."
  And they told me what grinder to by,
  which was great, 'cause I
  didn't know that either.
  While they were falling apart,
  my businesses were falling apart too.
  I had a music business and
  a book swapping business,
  and that was all cratering,
  and I was looking for
  something else to do.
  They, one day, sent an email out saying,
  "We can't ship, we've run out
  money, we're really sorry."
  At which point,
  I happen to be in California,
  I give them a call.
  I say, "Hello,
  it sounds like you need
  a little bit of money."
  'Cause they said, "We're so
  close to the finish line,
  we just need another
  million." or something,
  I don't remember what the number was.
  And I thought,
  "Okay, well I can write that check,
  and take over, and be a little
  bit of adult supervision."
  They brought the ZPM over
  with Blue Bottle beans,
  and they made me
  a quite good espresso.
  And so, there it was,
  working, making good coffee.
  The next thing I did
  was call up a friend in Seattle,
  because I happened to know
  La Marzocco, and Slayer,
  and Synesso are up in Seattle.
  And Bill Crossland, who'd
  been involved with the GS3,
  was one of the people who
  was willing to talk to me.
  Now, he makes the machine called the CC1,
  and what Bill said is,
  "Let me show you, kid,
  what the economics are of espresso."
  And he laid it all out to me
  and he said, "There's just no way
  you're gonna make a
  machine better than mine,
  at a cheaper price."
  "What if I just sell direct,
  then could I
  spend more money
  to make a better machine?"
  And he said,
  "If you're willing to sell direct only,
  yes, you can make a better machine."
  So, Bill essentially sent
  me in that direction,
  and he also said,
  "Don't buy ZPM,
  because it'll never get
  safety certification."
  And that was just him,
  his background, "You're just
  gonna die on that altar."
  And in fact they were dying on that altar,
  that's what they were talking about,
  was the safety certification
  was never gonna happen.
  But the real birth of Decent Espresso is
  finding that, I think
  there's a market for,
  what I call at the time,
  Seattle meet Italy.
  So, Italian espresso,
  which is what I liked at the time,
  but with a sort of
  Seattle spin of high tech,
  app, that sort of thing.
  And that would hopefully
  reduce the complexity
  of making good espresso.
  And then the second part,
  which was the launch of Decent Espresso,
  is everyone telling me,
  "For the amount you will spend
  to make ZPM come to market,
  you can start from scratch with people
  who've made espresso machines before,
  and you won't have any of their problems."
  But, of course, I had new problems,
  but that's why I went in a new direction.
  Because I decided to start from scratch
  and make my own machine,
  the ZPM guys said, "Hey, wait a second."
  "We've shown you everything,
  you need to cut us in here."
  And they're absolutely right, right.
  I saw this schematics, the software,
  I saw everything,
  and that was influencing
  the decisions I was making.
  So, it took a while,
  but we got to a point where
  they licensed their
  intellectual property to us
  so we could choose to
  use, it if we wanted to,
  in exchange for some money,
  and most importantly,
  a coupon to all the backers of ZPM
  that they could apply
  in the next three years to Decent.
  It took me about nine months
  to fall out of love with
  the approach that ZPM were taking.
  Because I tried the same approach,
  which is used cheap components,
  and a bit of software,
  and algorithms, PID dust,
  that little magic fairy dust,
  PID will solve everything,
  that didn't work at all.
  My ambition for a machine
  that I would sell for $1,000 US
  well, we had no product.
  And so, what I thought I
  could make for $1,000 US
  using essentially two Nespresso
  machines bolted together,
  would not make good coffee.
  So, this became now a
  multi-year R&D project.
  And it turned out that heating on demand
  is incredibly inaccurate on espresso.
  And so, we had to come
  up with new technologies
  to deal with that.
  What I realized was,
  that we had no idea how to make espresso
  good with light roast beans.
  That was actually the
  problem I wanted to solve.
  I had this very strong feeling that
  the entire espresso
  industry was pre-scientific.
  They don't measure anything,
  they don't create testable hypotheses.
  And testable hypotheses and measurement
  are the basis of science.
  And we had no idea what
  pressure flow and temperature
  would make delicious light-roasted coffee.
  So, let's just make sure
  that it can do anything.
  And in the computer world, we
  talk about Turing machines,
  which is a computer that
  can run any software.
  The idea behind the Decent was to make a
  Turing-compliant espresso machine.
  So, an espresso machine that could do
  any pressure, any flow, any temperature,
  because we have no idea what's gonna work.
  In so doing,
  it became quite expensive to make,
  and became a much harder project,
  but it also became much more interesting.
  So what ZPM really did for me,
  is get me interested,
  get my team together,
  and look at cheap components,
  and see what we could do
  with cheap components
  to make good espresso.
  And it turns out, that if
  you spend millions of dollars
  and develop all this
  intellectual property,
  you can actually take the
  inexpensive components
  and get them to do your bidding.
- And so that is how we go
  from the ZPM to the DE1,
  very different approaches,
  but an interesting connecting
  point between the two.
  And I cannot understate
  just how influential this thing has been.
  By letting us track
  everything, measure everything
  our understanding of espresso
  has fundamentally changed
  how we see flow, how we
  think about channeling,
  all of that stuff has been revolutionized
  by the DE1.
  And I think it's fair to call it
  the most influential machine in a decade.
  But this is not a review of the DE1,
  that will happen
  eventually on this channel,
  this is a video about the ZPM.
  It's finally time
  to fire this thing up,
  and see what it's capable of doing.
  Before we do that though,
  there is a short ad
  for this video sponsor,
  which is Surfshark.
  Surfshark is a fast,
  easy-to-use VPN service
  that is jam-packed full of features
  and lets you use unlimited devices
  with just one account.
  And this means, that when
  someone sends me a YouTube video
  that's really interesting, but I click it,
  and it says, "No, this is not
  available in your country."
  I'm not tearing my hair out,
  I'm just two clicks and a few
  seconds away from being in
  whatever geolocation I need to be in
  to watch the video.
  And it's not just YouTube,
  this unlocks the streaming
  services like Netflix,
  that lets me watch content
  that isn't available in the UK,
  that is available in other places.
  I wanna get all the value I can
  out of the streaming
  services that I pay for,
  and this is a great way to do it.
  More than this,
  it gives you an additional
  layer of security and privacy
  when you're online,
  whether you're at home, or you
  are traveling out at a cafe,
  or anywhere else.
  As I said, it's unlimited
  devices with just one account.
  And so, they have apps
  for just about everything,
  Mac, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android,
  you are going to be covered,
  and I think that is amazing.

  Thank you to Surfshark
  for sponsoring this video.
  Let's switch it on.
  (machine clicks)
  Every time I turn it on
  my heart is in my mouth
  because I'm terrified I'm
  just gonna break this thing
  and then it'll be gone.
  You know what I mean?
  Like it's, I dunno if I could repair this.
  Someone could, but I couldn't.
  Anyway, it's on,
  it's heating up, little
  temperature display here.
  It rockets up in temperature,
  which is kind of interesting,
  which has got a little
  thermoblock to heat in there.
  Now, this is obviously a US machine,
  that's running on 110V,
  I've got a chunky transformer
  under the bench here
  to allow me to run this thing on UK power.
  But while it's heating up,
  we'll do a quick tour of the machine.
  It's pretty simple, but there's
  a couple of notable things
  on this particular unit.
  So, obviously you've got your
  display on the front here.
  It's not a bad display,
  considering its age
  and the price point, it's not horrific.
  It's not touch, that's okay.
  You've got these control buttons here
  and this is something I'm
  definitely terrified of breaking.
  They just feel really flimsy and soft,
  and I have to be very delicate here.
  Two sturdier buttons,
  one that says "Start"
  and one that says "Mode."
  So, because it's a thermoblock,
  if you wanna steam milk,
  then you'd have to change the temperature
  of the sort of thermoblock to get steam.
  So, it can't do both at once.
  That's kind of it, on
  the front panel here,
  little drip tray, pretty nice.
  Now, you can see a water tank here.
  Actually, if I turn this to the side,
  you can see that the
  water tank does not fit,
  'cause this would've been a custom part
  that would've cost a lot of money to make.
  They didn't get that far.
  So this is just,
  I assume some other machine's water tank
  that sort of fits well enough,
  but it works.
  Also worth noting here,
  you appear to have a mini
  USB and an SD card slot.
  And impressively, we're
  actually up to temperature
  on the front.
  So, we've got a little
  ready symbol at the top.
  It says 95,
  94.9 degrees Celsius,
  lovely to see it in Celsius,
  didn't even put that on myself,
  but the correct temperature display.
  So, let's get into the menus of this thing
  because it gives a real insight into
  how this was gonna work,
  in terms of what you could program
  and what you could do with this thing.
  So, you've got a couple of
  pre-programmed options here.
  You've got single, which shows 93 Celsius,
  nine bars, 25 seconds.
  So, 25 seconds
  says that they're looking
  at like a fixed time,
  not a fixed volume of brewing.
  A few machines work this way,
  they'll brew a fixed amount of time,
  and you would adjust your
  grind to get the flow rate
  that you want,
  to get the kind of yield you want
  in that fixed time.
  Interestingly, the double
  pre-programmed here,
  same temperature, same
  pressure, 35 seconds.
  Which I hope is not suggesting
  that a single is just like
  a double cut earlier,
  'cause that would be wrong.
  You've then got settings,
  which we can jump into.
  And then I think you've got
  like a more manual thing
  where it's gonna do the
  temperature and pressure
  that you want,
  but it won't cut off
  after a certain amount of time.
  Settings, is again interesting.
  So, you can adjust your PID values
  around a bunch of different stuff.
  So, if we jump in,
  obviously your brew temperature
  and we tap in there.
  So you can set your proportional gain,
  you can set your integral gain,
  or you'll set your derivative gain.
  I dunno how to program a PID,
  if I'm totally honest.
  So, I'm not gonna mess with these values.
  Now, on the back screen,
  there's a little bit of
  immaturity in this machine.
  And so, the fact that it
  says "Back that ass up."
  I don't know,
  I don't think you should build that into a
  daily espresso machine,
  it just feels kind of weird.
  It just feels a little bit
  childish, if I'm honest.
  It's not that I'm against immaturity,
  but you know.
  I don't know, it's just
  a weird little thing.
  I don't know if it would've
  made it to production
  if it was just for the
  beta units or something,
  but there it is.
  We should make some coffee.
  Pour, I think we're
  just gonna pour manual,
  I think that's a good idea.
  I'm gonna brew it 94, I think.
  And I'm gonna brew at eight bars,
  'cause why not?
  And there it is, it's
  programmed very quickly.
  So, from a programming perspective,
  this is kind of a joy to use,
  this really is.
  But can it make good coffee?
  So, let's brew and this is interesting.
  (machine surges)
  So, right now it's kind
  of getting prepped.
  You can see negative pressure,
  it's seemingly filling
  the hydraulic circuit,
  getting ready, timer reads zero still.
  (machine continues to surge)
  Once we switch to positive pressure,
  (machine hums)
  okay, timer's on.
  Only about four bars of pre-infusion,
  and then it's gonna really spike it up.
  (machine continues to hum)
  (machine surges)
  So it's overshot there,
  so we're gonna need some
  PID control work done.
  Drops back down to about
  eight bars, which is good.
  (machine surges)
  Temperature, a little high.
  (machine continues to surge)
  Now it pulled a little
  longer than I'd want,
  but I think it's still worth tasting.
  Now, actually, just on the
  temperature gauge here,
  it's dropped down to
  like 80 degrees Celsius.
  So, I wonder if it's got a bit
  of a declining profile here
  with the heating stuff.
  Now some of you, like me,
  were you a backer?
  Watching this, are you thinking
  "Did I miss out or does it suck?"
  Let's find out.
  It's got a weird acidity to it
  that makes me feel like
  the brew temperature
  is not quite right.
  Actually, we could probably test that.
  We do have a Scace device
  that we can test the brew temperature with
  and see what it's actually doing,
  in terms of temperature
  and pressure delivered
  onto the puck.
  Maybe we should do that.
  Let's repeat this,
  and actually see
  what's happening inside the machine versus
  what it's telling us it's happening.
  Okay, so we've got a Scace
  2 device set up here.
  This has a temperature probe inside there
  and a flow restrictor to mimic
  the flow rate of an espresso
  that's running to this laptop.
  You can, sort of, in a second,
  see what this sort of
  screen recording of this is.
  You also have a pressure gauge here,
  which is the sort of pressure,
  including the loss of
  pressure through the puck.
  So typically, this would read
  about a bar lower than you would see
  at a pump.
  So, if it was nine bars at the pump,
  you'd see eight at the group head,
  'cause you're losing
  about a bar of pressure
  through the cake.
  Anyway, let's see what happens
  when we pull a shot.
  (machine humming)
  So we're coming up to pressure here,
  coming way up.
  Now, that's quite a big discrepancy.
  (machine humming and hissing)
  Oh, that's interesting.
  So looking at the brew temperature,
  it briefly spikes
  to about 91 degrees Celsius
  and then just crashes back down
  really, really quickly.
  And so, it's brewing way below,
  sort of, target temperature
  almost the entire time.
  There's a little leakage here,
  a pressure issue here.
  I think there's a problem
  with the grouphead solenoid.
  We'll touch on that in just a second.
  Hang on, let me stop this.
  Now, this was a beta testing
  unit that was out in the wild.
  So, this has been sort
  of shipped, so to speak,
  to somebody to test.
  And so, you'd expect it to perform
  a little bit more within spec
  than it was.
  So what you were seeing
  was it was thinking
  it was delivering about
  nine bars of pressure.
  What you were seeing at the puck though,
  was substantially below what you'd expect.
  The temperature piece though,
  really, really just miles away.
  And so, I don't know at this point,
  if it just needs its settings tweaked,
  but that kind of makes me
  a little hesitant to think
  that's the problem,
  that's the issue,
  or if maybe it was never ever gonna do
  what they really needed it to do.
  It's an interesting
  artifact of its time.
  It's definitely got some
  interesting ideas in there.
  It's a sad story that
  they didn't get to deliver
  what they wanted to deliver.
  But I'm left wondering
  if they were ever gonna deliver something
  that would've lived up
  to the expectations of the community
  and to the sort of
  technical expectations of
  really good, accurate espresso brewing?
  Now to caveat myself, again,
  and over, and over again,
  this has sat, you know,
  not making much coffee
  for quite a long time.
  I think there's something trapped inside
  the grouphead solenoid.
  That's a little sort of
  electromagnetic valve
  that pulls a piston up and down
  to control a three-way valve,
  and sometimes stuff gets trapped in there
  causing a kind of leak of pressure
  from the boiler itself,
  sort of through the system,
  and you'll see the group
  head dripping sometimes.
  So, this is not maybe
  in peak, peak condition,
  but what its sensors are showing
  versus what we're reading
  with these sort of mechanical readings
  or accurate readings of temperature
  are quite a long way apart.
  And that would be a huge concern for me,
  even if the maths was a little better,
  at staying on target
  when it was supposed to a
  little bit more accurately,
  it just seems to not really
  know what it's doing,
  in that particular regard.
  And I dunno why that may be the case,
  I don't know if that's
  bad build, if that's bad componentry,
  if that's something else,
  they're using cheap parts
  by their own admission,
  maybe that was the issue.
  There's lots I like about this,
  I like the form of it.
  I think it looks kind of cute,
  it's boxy in a charming way.
  I like the interface,
  it's simple, it let me
  do what I needed to do,
  but I'm not sure it delivered.
  I don't wanna savage this,
  this is flawed,
  it's not working the way it should,
  but it's really interesting.
  And it will go
  to one of my Patreon supporters,
  because Patreon lets me
  kind of have a budget
  to go and acquire these things,
  test these things, and make these videos,
  and I'm very grateful to them.
  So, this will be going into
  one of them in a giveaway soon.
  But I'd love to hear your thoughts,
  were you a ZPM backer?
  How do you feel now
  knowing that for your $200,
  you may not have got
  what you wanted?
  I'd love to hear from you,
  whether you backed it or not,
  down in the comments below.
  But for now,
  I'll say thank you so much for watching,
  and I hope you have a great day.
