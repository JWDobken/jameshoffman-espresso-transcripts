## The Ultimate Grinder Showdown Finale (Episode #6)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LGeBcUZ9YA>

welcome to the ultimate grinder showdown
here we're gonna take five of the most
sought after grinders for the home
and pit them head to head in a battle to
the death
maybe not the death but they're gonna
battle it out to see which is
the best or ultimately which one i would
recommend to you
now i've made a video on each of these
different grinders already
if you want to check that there's links
in the description there's a little
playlist up here as well if you just
want to watch those
before we get stuck in they'll give you
more info on the grinders their
backgrounds
some of the technical details behind
them but to refresh your memory starting
over here
we have the lagom p64 64 mil burs
variable rpm
we've got the weber workshops eg1 80mm
burst variable rpm
we've got the monolith max by kaffir
tech 98 mil burs
variable rpm the levercraft ultra 98 mil
burs
variable rpm and on the end the
mulkernig
ek-43s 98mm burs but
fixed speed motor we're going to put
them through a battery of tests
and some will be subjective that will
involve me tasting and telling you what
i think
and some will be objective things around
retention and other kinds of performance
too
we're going to start off with some
espresso tasting first of all i'm going
to be pulling shots of all of these and
i'll try and talk to you
about how they taste different which
ones i like more than others
i'll explain a bit more about that in a
second then to give my palette a little
bit of a break
we'll do some objective testing we'll do
retention and i've got a couple of
interesting tests there
then we'll do some filter coffee testing
where we'll do both pour over and
immersion brews to see
how they perform within that kind of
sphere of coffee brewing
and then finally a few more little
objective tests around
speed and noise and that kind of stuff
and then i'll wrap up and give you
my recommendations so now i'm going to
dial all of these in
i'm going to dial them all in on a flat
9 bar profile with this machine
we'll use a different profile afterwards
with a different machine i'm going to
pull shots of each one
and i'll tell you how those shots taste
now it won't be a blind test
today so i understand that now i
actually want to bring in
my experience over the last couple of
months with these grinders tasting
coffee tasting shots
when i talk about how the espressos
taste otherwise evaluating an entire
grinder on a single shot of espresso
is a little bit silly and redundant but
if i'm talking about that espresso and
bringing in
my experience with the grinder i hope i
can give you a little bit more
information
let's dial in now we're going to be
doing an 18 gram dose in we're going to
be doing a 40 gram dose out
slightly longer than two to one should
be a fairly level playing field for all
the grinders
now when i'm tasting these i'm going to
be stirring them sipping them and
spitting them out again and rinsing
aggressively to try and keep my palate
going through this tasting
i'll also give you a score across a
number of factors like sweetness
clarity and texture and maybe an overall
score these aren't particularly
meaningful i'm just trying to
communicate
to you how the shots are different with
some pretty simple numbers
i'll use some descriptors too but i
won't wax lyrical about each of the
shots because
you're not tasting what i'm tasting and
i'm just trying to communicate to you
what the espresso is like now time for
the first shot from the legome
p64 from option o this espresso has nice
texture i would score it maybe an eight
out of ten for
texture sweetness is pleasant but
probably a seven i know this probably
could have a little bit more sweetness
but it's
it's pretty well extracted i would say a
seven again for balance
this is very enjoyable espresso so don't
don't get me wrong a 10 across the board
would
be a life-changing kind of thing here so
it's it's
nicely textured it's nicely extracted i
feel it's got a little bit more that it
could give
but but it is still a balanced enjoyable
shot very nice finish
so overall probably probably like a
seven
seven and a half it's a it's a very nice
shot of espresso
let's move on espresso from the eg1
texture is
very nice it feels textured and balanced
and full and rich
uh enjoyable layout probably give that
an eight uh sweetness again
it is clean it is pronounced it is a
kind of eight out of ten for sweetness
quite enjoyable balance again
probably an eight this is a very
enjoyable shot it's performing very well
here
it lacks a little bit for clarity but
not a huge amount but if i was to pick
it apart
that would be where i'd be like oh a
little little fussier there
but overall a very enjoyable shot eight
out of ten definitely enjoyed this
really a lot so the monolith max
what you notice up front here is is
sweetness actually this is quite a
strong intense sweetness it's very
pleasant
i i'm gonna say eight and a half nine
for sweet like
really nice sweetness in this espresso
clarity is also pretty good kind of an
eight
um texture probably a seven it's it's
pleasant it's just not as full as
the the previous two shots its
concentration feels high its extraction
feels quite high
um it is a very very enjoyable
espresso shot for me it's like an eight
eight and a half overall
that sweetness really does appeal to me
it's very nicely extracted yeah
this is delicious very good
espresso heavy craft ultra interesting
little shot
sweetness very nice quite present quite
strong sweetness
uh probably an eight for sweetness i
would say the texture is a little
lighter here this feels more of a
unimodal style espresso where you have
um just a little less texture for your
extraction
probably say seven for the texture
balance clarity
are really there kind of like a kind of
a nine in that regard like tons of
clarity
really quite a balanced shot nice finish
but just missing that texture
overall it's an eight it's a very good
shot but i i would want just a touch
more texture in those espressos but
tons of clarity ek-43 shot
that is a tasty espresso it doesn't have
a super pronounced sweetness i would say
a solid
8 there it has nice texture i would say
another 8 there
it has nice clarity it's another eight
there it's a good
all-rounder shot it has enough texture
to not feel like it's a super super
linear espresso you'll hear me use the
word unimodal a lot today i suspect
and that's a grind distribution thing
where there's a peak of of particle
sizes
and there aren't tons of fines there
aren't tons of boulders most things are
are one size and that's considered in
many cases highly desirable
but with espresso it is more complicated
that though
is a nice espresso it's kind of like a
straight eights kind of shot
so very tasty very tasty indeed
now as a kind of interlude between this
round of testing and the next
it seemed appropriate to bring in some
sort of benchmark a grinder i've talked
about before and that
is the much much much cheaper conical
bird niche grinder this is 500 pounds
a third of the price pretty much of of
the cheapest one of the grinders that
i'm testing
it's konica bear all the others are flat
so
for the money how big is the difference
there's a couple things that spring to
mind here firstly this is
just a little less extracted tasting
than the others there
it has a little bit more acidity a
little bit more harshness
compared to the others it's not a bad
shot
i'm not saying it doesn't taste good i'm
just saying the others have
initially a little bit more extraction
and therefore a little bit more balance
if i was to rate this for balance i
would say something like a six in terms
of sweetness
six to seven it has some sweetness it's
quite nice in terms of texture
yeah probably like a seven again in
terms of clarity
that's again where it falls down in
comparison to some of these grinders
here
these very large flat burs seem to just
give you
just that that extra nudge more clarity
and by clarity it's a tricky word
i mean it's easier to pick apart flavors
there's a kind of comparative
muddiness to this compared to the others
it's still a nice shot it's still an
enjoyable shot
and and by saying it's a six out of ten
that feels harsh in comparison to
some of the other stuff but it's up
against some of the best grinders in the
world that have scored sevens and eights
here and again i do just want to clarify
these numbers are completely arbitrary
right i'm just trying to communicate
differences
uh with numbers as a communication tool
that they don't mean anything
it's not something worth like sticking
in front of this grinder this is a 6 out
of 10 shot grinder that makes no sense
whatsoever i'm just trying to
communicate differences to you
now let's get on with pulling some
interesting shots with the decent we're
going to run some interesting
longer profiles that have much longer
pre-infusions they're going to push
these grinders into a finer place
and see what happens if we just brew a
different style of espresso so what
we're using is a slightly tweaked
version of the cremina profile on the
decent that involves a very long
pre-infusion kind of a soaking phase and
then it ramps up a little bit and then
slowly ramps down again mimicking a long
pre-infusion on a lever machine
and it pushes you to grind much finer
the total shot time is around 48 to 50
seconds
for that same 18 in and 40 out
instead of going through shot by shot
again and taking a really long time
i'm going to do that quick tasting of
the five espressos back to back and i'll
give you a quick summary
at the end of it of some differences and
things that i found that were
interesting so having tasted a bunch
more espresso i kind of feel like
nothing i tasted particularly
changed my mind about how i felt about
these grinders to start with
the world of espresso once you factor in
stuff like changing profiles of pressure
or flow
it just becomes expansive and huge these
are all incredibly capable grinders they
do produce
different styles of espresso and i stand
behind how i've
sort of described them to date and
there's kind of been a summary of my
experience over the last couple of
months using them
every day here in the studio when it
comes to choosing a grinder based on
taste know that with all of these
grinders you can change the bur sets out
and
with that will come enormous change and
so that's why it's been important to me
in the other reviews to talk about
workflow and those kind of aspects we'll
now move into two rounds of
retention testing here in the first
round
we're going to do a simple experiment
we're going to pre-weigh out
three doses of coffee at 18 grams
exactly and we're going to grind them
and see what comes out each time
with each of the grinders we'll go with
their recommended workflows in terms of
uh using bellows if they come with
bellows removing magnetic
funnels and sweeping them out all that
kind of stuff just to see
how they do these are all single dose
grinders and what you really want to see
is if you put 18 grams in
you really want 18 grams out so i'll be
back in a second
to tell you the results of that test and
also tell you about the second retention
test
so i'm looking at the results here and
it was an interesting test the
the grinders that did the best were the
ones that you could almost take to
pieces to completely sweep out
both the ultra and the monolith max did
incredibly well across the board the
grinders did
very well the variance of about 0.1 of a
gram i think is beyond acceptable in
these kind of scenarios
the ek did have a little bit of a tricky
time where it seemed to sort of retain
a chunk of coffee .3 of a gram one time
that kind of came out into the next one
which gave it a much larger variation
in its sort of dose-to-dose and that can
happen you know getting
everything out of the ek is a little
trickier i will say
points to the eg1 here there was no
process to go through there were no
bellows there was no dissembly of
anything
there was no ritual to go through it
just spat out pretty much what you put
in and the sweeper system inside that
grinder is
very effective so points there now the
second retention test
is a little bit different because i want
to look at the idea of exchange a little
bit more
what exactly is being retained and how
much is kind of being exchanged you know
is some coffee always retained
but you know the old coffee gets pushed
out by the new but then some
you know new coffee becomes the old
coffee trapped inside
so to test that i have a i hope a very
simple test
all the grinders will be dialed in for
espresso and they'll pull a shot and
we'll just log that short time
then we'll move them all to
approximately like a v60 setting and
grind through 20 grams of coffee
then we'll pull them back to their grind
setting for espresso and pull a shot
if they have no exchange going on if
nothing is really retained
meaningfully they should pull a very
normal espresso shot straight away
if they are retaining and exchanging
some coffee that next shirt of espresso
will have some of that coarser grind in
it and i would expect the grinders
to produce a kind of faster flowing
espresso if they have a higher quantity
of coffee exchanging
whenever you grind so i hope that
retention test makes sense
let's see what the results are now i'll
put the results of this test up on
screen so you can see what i'm talking
about and i'll try and make sense of
these
results i think they're very insightful
and they do correlate with the retention
test that we did
first looking through the first couple
of grinders the p64 and the eg-1
both of them uh after they'd had a sort
of a session of course grinding
the next shot was a little bit faster
and the shot after that
went back to a normal speed again that
indicated there was a little bit of
coffee
retained inside the grinder at that
corsa grind that sort of needed to be
worked out
that means i would recommend purging a
small amount when making large changes
with these grinders the next two
the monolith max and the levercraft
ultra both did really
really well in this test and again they
were the the best performing on the
retention perspective
as well now it might look like the max
initially didn't do that well the first
shot was 30 seconds then we coarsely
ground coffee and then the next shot was
27 seconds
but the shot after that was also 27
seconds
indicating that i might have just moved
the grinder to not quite a fine enough
position
i thought i'd got it right but i could
have made a mistake there and the fact
that those two shots ran
identically one after the other
indicates that there really wasn't any
coarsely ground coffee left behind
from that corso grinding session that
had all been gotten rid of
the worst performing here by far was the
eek43s
the retention on the first test wasn't
very good and the retention on this test
certainly wasn't very good
that shot after we cost the ground some
coffee and moved it back to position
ran really really fast and the shot
after that
same position got back to a nearly
normal flow rate again so
clearly there was coarser ground coffee
retained inside it
so yeah if you're making big changes
with nikkei i would also recommend
purging a small amount of coffee through
that grinder
might only need to be three four five
grams but something should go through
just to make sure that you're exchanging
any of that sort of coarsely ground
coffee for some finer ground coffee
so that's it for espresso testing for
now we're going to look at some filter
coffee we're going to look at pour-overs
and i've
wracked my brain about an effective way
to do this and and it is a tricky one
i don't want to just go and sort of find
out how fine i can go
while it still tastes good because poor
others are a percolation brew and if you
watch that recent video on immersion
versus percolation
you'll know that technique is the
ceiling here not necessarily the grinder
so here i'm going to set them all to a
very similar extraction level for a pour
over
i'm going to aim for about 22 extraction
it's a little bit arbitrary i
absolutely give you that but i'll be
using a refractometer to dial them in
identically
and then i'll taste them and compare
them i'll be curious to see
how big the differences really are so
we're ready for the tasting part now and
i'm actually really excited about this
now this is not a blind tasting because
the idea that i would judge a grinder on
a single cup of coffee
is completely absurd i'm gonna use this
comparative tasting
because it's really interesting for me
as well to to do this comparatively
but i do want to bring with me the
experience of brewing coffee on these
grinders
over the last couple of months i will
say it looks like this is shot in one
day
this video has been shot over multiple
days to you know combat palette fatigue
as well
let's get into some tasting now as i
said these have all been dialed in to a
very similar extraction level
and one that was below the point at
which it was sort of too fine for a v60
technique to work where you get a lot of
channeling and that kind of stuff so
they're all
very well extracted and they all taste
very nice i think what you see again is
that i have the high uniformity burst
set here in the p64 a burst set
optimized around espresso
because it gives a slightly wider
particle distribution
and i think you can taste that here it
has just a little bit more texture which
some people might really enjoy
but it has a little less clarity of
flavor
than some of the other cups here
interestingly what you saw from a
drawdown perspective is that
this had the slowest drawdown whereas
the two grinders i think are sort of
hitting high uniformity the most
effectively which would be
the monolith max and the levercraft
ultra they had the quickest drawdowns
the ek and the eg both had
sort of similar drawdowns the ek was
actually slightly slower that was
interesting so moving into the eg1
really a very nice sweet brew no real
astringents here this sort of higher
extraction very pleasant
nice clarity very enjoyable no
complaints here and even though again it
feels like a burst set that is
not optimized for espresso necessarily
but but you know slightly less
uniform it feels like in comparison to
the p64 the eg1 has a little bit more
uniformity
and you can taste that in a little bit
more clarity
what about the max
this is an interesting cup to me you
know this grinder i feel is optimized
around espresso brewing
and more unimodal style espresso brewing
the cup here is again
sweet and that's been a feature that
we've come up against a couple times
with this grinder it is
to something like possibly lacking a
little complexity compared to some of
the others
but it is incredibly enjoyable i'm aware
i'm nitpicking right now because you
don't usually get to compare
these grinders side by side and if i was
just drinking this cup of coffee
i'd be having a very nice time it is
very enjoyable it feels
perhaps a little bit more linear not
simple necessarily but but just lacking
a touch of complexity compared to the
others
tasting the lever craft i say compared
to the others but these two cups
are to me the the most similar they're
different and and there's actually a
little bit less texture in the ultra
which is interesting it's quite a kind
of light
bright sweet nice complexity but not
quite as full even though it's a similar
kind of extraction
i cannot infer what that means i can
only tell you what it tastes like
again i've enjoyed brewed coffee from
this grinder very much it's tasted
very nice indeed the ek here
is performing well but i feel it is a
little outshone
i'm not sure exactly which burst set is
in the ek right now i feel like they've
changed it around
a few times recently this is a very nice
cup
it doesn't have any flaws necessarily it
just
lacks a little bit of the clarity that
many of the other cups here have
it has texture it has some sweetness you
know you can taste the coffee
there it's important to clarify just how
close these are you know in in the wider
context of good and bad coffee
these are all absolutely clustered up at
the very end of
very good and it's kind of by zooming
into that that we're picking apart the
differences this is all very tasty
so there's one piece of testing we did
that i think was very interesting we
ground some coffee to test
the speed of sort of throughput of the
grinders and at the same time compared
the sort of sound levels they produce
running empty and
running grinding now this was pretty
simple to do we put the the decibel
meter a fixed distance
from the grinders each time and we ran
it with and without coffee
and here are the results now what i will
say
about the the sound levels in particular
is that they don't tell the whole story
decibels don't tell you
how pleasant the sound was so alongside
this information i'll give you my
ranking of
nicest sounding to least nice sounding
at the top the nicest sounding grinder
is the levercraft
it is the least offensive sounding to me
when it's grinding coffee
second is probably the p64 third
probably
is the monolith it's technically the
quietest but it doesn't sound quite as
pleasant as the others
fourth would be the eg1 and fifth is the
ek-43 because it is just
so much louder than the others and it's
quite an abrasive sound
because it's so loud in terms of
productivity in terms of how quickly
they grind this was an interesting test
in particular because i think it speaks
to the fact that rpm is not everything
when it comes to speed
and i think people correlate them a
little bit too closely even though i was
using grinders at different rpms really
it's the burst set that will drive this
and that's best illustrated by the fact
that
if you run the monolith max at 350 and
the levercraft ultra 350
there is a huge huge difference in
grinding time
the levercraft is just much much much
faster than the monolith
i'm not here to say that's good or bad
i'm just here to highlight the
differences in speed
between the grinders now i think
we should probably wrap up and i'll talk
through each of the grinders and give
a kind of summary of my thoughts and
share which one
or ones were my favorites so how do i
summarize the glorious absurdity of this
particular video of all of this testing
because i feel like a spoiled brat
complaining about
the nicest toys money can buy they're
all fantastic grinders
i'll have little complaints about it all
of them but i will say
they all do a great job of making
delicious coffee
so by way of a summary i'll tell you who
i think might be the perfect candidate
for each of these grinders
so the lagon p64 from option o i think
if you're a bit space constrained if
you're a little bit budget constrained
compared to the rest of the stuff here
then it makes for an excellent choice if
you're
looking for something for an espresso
setup then yeah i think the high
uniformity burs work
super well yes they're a little bit
smaller in terms of burst size than the
rest of them here but i
i don't feel like it's a massive
compromise from that perspective
if you were looking for something to do
a bit of both that that's a harder
choice to me
because you know you're not
realistically going to be switching burs
very often
as easy as it is to do with this grinder
but
i think for espresso particularly it's a
pretty great choice
the eg1 is the most expensive grinder
but i think from a build and
construction perspective you can
absolutely see where your money is going
it's incredibly well built it's
incredibly thoughtfully built
the detail is there throughout and in
terms of performance
it's a great all-rounder if you need
great espresso great filter coffee
and something that is sympathetic to
that workflow
this is a great choice but it's very
expensive but
i understand why and i i don't think
it's overpriced for what you're getting
in the world of high-end grinders the
monolith max again
very very expensive and it feels more
focused from a workflow and build
perspective
around espresso and it does perform well
for espresso too really well i really
enjoyed the shots from this
very delicious it does perform well for
filter coffee but
i feel like the workflow isn't optimized
the same way that a grinder like this
might be
however if i had the budget and i just
brewed espresso all the time
i would be tempted by this grinder the
levercraft ultra
to me kind of feels like it belongs in a
in an espresso lab
somewhere where you'd have the space to
accommodate all of it as well as a place
where you'd want to do the kind of
experiments that only this grinder
lets you do grinding at different rpm
feels like you're at the fringe of
espresso
experimentation and then throwing an rpm
profiling feels like you're at the
fringe of that fringe
like it is a brave new world i don't
know what will come of it but if you are
the sort of person that
wants to do those kind of experiments
this is an interesting option
its performance was excellent it was
enjoyable to use
i didn't love the build as much as some
of the others but but it is a well-made
grinder the malkonic e64
has one singular advantage over all the
rest of them
if you need to grind more than 50 grams
of coffee at a time well
really this is it this is a workhorse
it's built to do high volumes it's built
to be in a cafe
most of these other grinders are
expressly built for the home you know
these are built for the home and not
for cafes this is built for a cafe but
this is really built to be
a jack of all trades in a commercial
environment if you want that performance
at home i understand why you might
choose this but i just don't think it's
optimized for a home experience i don't
think it's optimized
for the workflow of making either filter
coffee or espresso especially at home
but commercially speaking it's the only
one i would consider
putting into a cafe and for that reason
it sort of doesn't belong
in this grouping but because people are
buying them for the home it seemed
necessary to include it
in this testing group so if i had to
pick one
if i had to pick one which would i pick
and to be honest i'd be torn between
these two grinders here
the two most expensive ones i think for
my personal applications where i'm
brewing
a lot of different coffee when i'm
brewing espresso and bring filter and
i'm bouncing around
all over the place this might be the
winner
for me the workflow the performance all
of those things work for
my particular needs and so this is
probably
my favorite grinder of these ones here
but it just pips the monolith which i
really enjoyed using fantastic
performance and again if my workflow is
even more espresso heavy than it is now
this might have been an
even more difficult decision for me to
make now if you're watching this and
you've got something like a
a baratza sette or a wilfy uniform or a
fellow ode or
something like that one of those kind of
grinders i don't want you to think that
you're
massively missing out on your coffee
experience here we're really talking
about chasing down
you know those diminishing returns and
they are diminishing returns
yes you could taste the difference
between these two grinders if you took a
mid-range grinder on any one of these
things
yes you would taste the difference but
it's pretty small
in the great scheme of coffee from bad
coffee to okay coffee to great coffee
you're really working within a small
section of quality
so so you should know what your money
gets you if you ever chose to spend more
and it does improve coffee but it is an
incremental improvement
but for those of us obsessed with the
details and wanting to go as far as we
can
well that's why these grinders exist now
i don't get to keep
any of these these will get given away
to my patreon backers they've allowed me
to go and buy these five incredible
grinders put them up at the bench
compare them contrast them
and experiment and honestly i've learned
a ton i've enjoyed
all of this and i hope you've enjoyed
coming along with me on this little
journey if you haven't watched their
individual reviews then
go and check those out there's a bit
more nitpicking a bit more history a bit
more background on each of the grinders
if you want to know more
and i'd love to hear from you now down
in the comments below
which was your favorite which one would
suit your application
the best but for now i'll say thank you
so much for watching
i hope you have a great day
