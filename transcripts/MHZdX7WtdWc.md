## The Kafatek Monolith Flat Max (Episode #5)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHZdX7WtdWc>

welcome to
episode five of the ultimate grinder
showdown we've been taking these five
grinders through their paces one review
every day
and it will culminate in a big
head-to-head showdown covering lots of
stuff around espresso
filter coffee taste all of that good
stuff and today
we're going to be looking at this it's
the monolith
max with the best named grinder so far
and and if you look at it you can see
why it's called the monolith
now this grinder i paid full price for
like all the other grinders here and
it's
three thousand two hundred and fifty
dollars which makes it one of the most
expensive grinders
here as disclosure though these operate
on a pre-order
only so they open up pre-orders very
briefly everyone scrambles to try and
get an order in and then they close them
i was not able to get a max on pre-order
i was able to get something else but
they upgraded my order to a max
for this review let me give you a little
background on cafetech
the company behind the monolith the
company i think dates back to 2012 but
this grinder as a project dates back to
2014 and it's been through several
iterations along the way
now inside of this grinder i will say
that there are the latest set of custom
made
burs designed by dennis the founder of
cafetec
they're called shuriken the sort of
burst sets that he creates and these are
called the shuriken suite
which is very interesting but before we
get into pulling a shot let's just have
a quick
walk through what's going on with this
grinder here
starting over on this side here you'll
see there's a little controller
that is an rpm controller because once
again we've got a variable rpm grinder
this runs up to a max rpm of 500
which is much much much lower than most
of the other grinders here that can run
at higher rpms
it'll go all the way down to five but
again that's not really a
viable rpm to be using day to day i've
been running at 350 as was recommended
to me this control box is doing
all of that motor control but your motor
is here angled sideways which is kind of
nice
the angling here running up to the
burset here coffee in
coffee out now the design feels not
quite utilitarian but it feels
more like function first and that
appeals to a lot of people
i quite like how this looks as a whole
the the quality of build feels
very solid it's not too heavy to be
annoying but it's solid it's not really
going anywhere on your countertop
it feels very tightly sort of machined
all the tolerances are very very nice
it's been enjoyable to use now as is
custom let's quickly talk through some
of the accessories that come with these
grinders we'll start with
a disappointing thing this is the dosing
cup that you would wear your coffee
beans
into and it's a little bit cheap in
comparison to some of the other pieces
here and it doesn't really fit
with the wider aesthetic of the grinder
this custom-made dosing funnel that you
would put on top of your portafilter
does feel quite nice it does have a
small floor to me in that the way it
sits is with this piece
inside the basket and it's really
designed for 58 mil baskets
when you pull it out it does feel like
it leaves a little gap around the edge
and that's
easily gotten rid of but but it's not
something that i particularly
love about this but otherwise it's a
very nice little funnel comes with a
spray bottle and i think the monolith
was one of the first grinders to start
shipping with a spray bottle
it also comes with a distribution tool
and this one
it's okay it does the job of breaking up
clumps it's not a particularly fine
needle needlepoint here but it still
works quite well
it's not my favorite but it's a nice
little tool and then it does come
with a set of bellows and these would go
on top here
once you've sort of started grinding and
you would
use it like that to blow through a
little layer to help clear any ground
coffee from
inside the bird chamber it's not it's
not bad it works quite well
it is a material it's a rubber that does
pick up dirt
relatively easily but overall a nice
little collection of accessories
now this is an espresso first kind of
grinder and you can tell that one
because it's
back to portafilter forks these are
pretty easy to adjust there's two screws
here that would change the width of them
to accommodate whatever portafilter you
have and make sure it holds them quite
tight
i would make sure you have a pretty snug
fit otherwise you could have a little
vibration causing the portafilter to
fall out
and you can adjust the height here and
here to have it be a
low or higher as you desire the grind
runs from zero round to ten though
espresso generally speaking is in this
sort of section of the grinder over here
you can go past 10 can go coarser that
way and if you're brewing filter coffee
you would certainly want to do that but
but from a design perspective from a use
perspective
it is espresso first
let's make some coffee
the idea that i might take off this
piece here to brush it out to make sure
i've got
every scrap of coffee out of this
grinder is new to me but
after a little while i kind of enjoyed
that slightly slower process around
prepping espresso
and this exit shoot attached by a magnet
innovation i think was was
first seen on a monolith
i've had a lot of very nice espresso
from this grinder and stylistically it
is
more of a unimodal style espresso where
you're having
plenty of extraction clarity sweetness
all of that stuff
not a ton of texture i sometimes wonder
whether
calling the burs sweet has put an idea
in my head
but shots have been sweet tasty
enjoyable but again i am working with
relatively light espresso roasts or sort
of light to medium espresso roasts
anyway
but the shots very delicious when it
comes to filter coffee though
i do have a couple of little
frustrations beyond the fact that there
isn't an
obvious sort of solution for dosing into
something for filter coffee this feels
very espresso forwards
and the grind sort of range is an
additional frustration for me there
because by the time i'm brewing for
filter i've moved my little marker past
the 10 point
now i know what some people have done is
put an additional sticker on
the adjuster so that as they move it
past that point that comes
into range here and so their filter
sticker they might know
that goes to two for a v60 or
four for a two cup or something like
that but then they know the other one
when they come back
they're around three for espresso that's
a nice little hack it's neat it's very
effective
i just wish it wasn't necessary on a
grinder that's this expensive
that is capable of brewing great filter
coffee
and my other complaints about it and i
get to complain about everything because
that's just who i am
are relatively minimal it is slow and
sometimes frustratingly slow and you
could argue
if that's going to yield me better
tasting espresso that's probably okay
and i'll
i'll to some extent accept that i know
we need to do more work on rpm
in a future video and how that impacts
flavor and other stuff this piece here
is actually a separate piece
it's a little funnel that prevents
anything popcorning and bouncing back
out again
uh i just wish this funnel piece here
was a little bit
steeper i've found that occasionally
especially when you sprayed the beans
you can get a little bit of
stickage here where beans just don't
want to fall in and you've got to just
poke them in like that
so i would just change this little angle
here on this funnel if it were me
otherwise it's a very nice piece now if
you want to access those large burs it's
a little bit of work you can see you're
going to need tools
to get in here so it's not going to be
something you're going to do every day
you can get a bit of access by sort of
taking this piece off and going in
through the funnel here and giving it
like a bit of a brush out if you want to
but it's not meaningful
in terms of actually getting into the
bird chamber now this isn't something i
would necessarily change i just
generally prefer grinders where it's
easier to access the bur set here
this piece as a little spout a little
exit spout
is very neat very simple and i like that
a lot but
in terms of componentry the the actual
box that controls your rpm
doesn't feel in keeping with the rest of
the unit the unit is
very heavy very solidly made this is i
suspect a third-party component
something brought in and placed inside
but it just doesn't feel as nice
it's pretty easy to use you just use
your dial to choose your desired rpm
and you push the button in to save that
rpm from the usability perspective
it's great i just wish it felt just a
little bit nicer like everything else on
here
does and again this box is a big box and
i like having it under the machine i
like this integration
of everything here but it it it does
give you a certain kind of boxy
aesthetic and a kind of funny proportion
sometimes
but i understand that this is
constrained by the size of the
components inside
it can be a little bit messy the the
bellows here
often blow a little bit of coffee around
onto the forks here and onto the base
unit here
it's easy and exposed and simple to
clean but it is
a touch messy compared to some of the
other grinders but
i don't think the worst necessarily but
worth noting
overall i like this grinder a lot i like
the results from it a lot i like using
it a lot
uh the workflow works pretty well for me
yes there's some nicer accessories with
other grinders but
from a shot perspective from a brood
coffee perspective
i think it does very well and it'll be
interesting to see how it stacks up
against the other four grinders in the
big head-to-head
coming tomorrow i'm very excited to get
into the tasting and really
compare and contrast side by side now i
don't get to keep this unit
this goes to one of my patreon
supporters because patreon gives me a
budget every month
to buy these things like a normal person
not get freebies or loaners or discounts
from manufacturers
and then i can give you honest unbiased
opinions i'll miss it
and i'll miss all of them but if you
want to know which one i would keep
given the chance well you'll just have
to watch the video
coming very soon the culmination of
grinder week
a giant head to head showdown
but now i'd like to hear from you down
in the comments below do you do you have
one of these
do you have one of the latest ones you
have an earlier one how has your
experience been how are your shots which
burst set do you have
have you tried the new shuriken suite 2
are you going to upgrade or change
i'd love to hear from you down in the
comments below but for now
i say thank you so much for watching and
i hope you have a great day
