## $50 vs $500 Vs $500,000 Coffee Grinder

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkYqHWThIpA>

I am so excited to make today's video,
I've wanted to make this for years.
Today, we're gonna to
compare a $50 grinder,
a $500 grinder,
with a $500,000 coffee grinder!
Let me explain what's going on.
I am here at Cometeer in
Gloucester, Massachusetts.
And if you don't know Cometeer,
they buy delicious coffee,
they extract it, they flash freeze it,
and you, when you want to drink it,
melt it back into hot water,
or even cold water if you want to,
and drink and enjoy.
Now, when I was here,
I did ask if I could
indulge in making a video
I've wanted to make for literally years.
I wanted to play with
the fanciest of fancy coffee grinders,
and they very kindly said
yes, with a few caveats.
Now a couple of important disclosures.
I'm here for a couple of reasons.
Firstly, I'm here to taste
some of the extractions,
some of the capsules they've
made of Square Mile's Coffee,
and secondly, I do have
an ongoing relationship with Cometeer.
So watching this,
you should absolutely treat
this video like an ad.
I might have told you a little
bit of a lie earlier on.
I said what I showed you was
a half million dollar grinder.
It's sort of is and it isn't.
I showed you the bit
that you load the coffee beans into.
The grinder itself was out of shot.
And as accommodating
as Cometeer have been,
they did have one hard line,
I can't go into the secret room
where they grind and extract coffee,
'cause they're doing some
proprietary stuff in there
and we can't film that.
But otherwise, we can have some fun still.
So here's the lineup.
We've got a $50 grinder,
we've got a $500 grinder,
and we've got a half
million dollar grinder,
and we're gonna do some tests.
And we're gonna start
with some taste tests.
I'm going to brew coffee,
I'm gonna just a pour-over,
30:500 of each of the three,
and just have a taste
and see what's going on.
But let's look a little bit
more at our contenders today.
$50 for the Sboly, I think?
It says it's a conical burr grinder.
You've got your grind
adjustment at the front here.
We have already kind of
matched the grind settings
across all three grinders.
This is at nearly its finest setting,
which is kind of interesting.
Now next to it is a grinder
I'm pretty excited to test,
It's the new Baratza
Vario+, it's about $500.
It's not on general sale yet,
and I'm grateful to Baratza
for agreeing to sell me one
of these a little bit early.
Interestingly to me,
to match the grinds between the two
we're at a very coarse
setting on this grinder,
'cause it's espresso capable.
This, despite saying it can do extra fine,
hmm, for $50, no, I don't think it can.
So before we go too much further,
I do need to very quickly explain
the differences between the
burr sets of the three grinders,
'cause they're all different.
The cheapest one has a
conical shaped burr set,
the central burr is a kind of cone-shape,
which gives you a lot of cutting surface
for relatively low RPMs.
And it's very common in cheaper grinders
to have conical burr sets,
'cause that way they can kick
out a lot of ground coffee
without having a powerful motor.
A lot of people would
prefer flat burr sets.
These have two flat disks
that spin against each
other with cutting teeth,
and these are, for many people,
preferable to conical burr
sets in lots environments
for having a sort of more uniform
particle size distribution.
But the big, fancy,
fancy expensive grinder
doesn't work like either of these.
Instead, it has roller mills.
Now these are kind of long,
cylindrical sort of burrs essentially,
and they have 2 per set that
roll in towards each other
and the beans are fed between the middle.
And you have multiple
stages of these rollers
and you can control each one,
so you have really high throughput
and a ton of control over
how you grind the coffee.
So what I'll do first
is I'm gonna grind 30
grams of coffee in each one
and we'll have a listen,
see how it goes and, and make a V60.
(machine grinding)
That's pretty quiet.
Yeah, that smells like burning motor.
You could really smell the motor
struggling with that coffee,
and that was not a good smell
or a reassuring smell, if I'm honest.
The Baratza.
(machine grinding)
Just looking at these,
you can see a difference.
Notable to me, it felt like the Baratza
was a little bit slower,
but we are gonna do
some speed tests later,
which will be kind of fun.
So I'll get the coffee now
from the big fancy grinder
and we'll start making some pour-overs.
So we brewed three V60s, 30
grams in, 500 grams of water.
Here is the Sboly, this is the Baratza,
and this is the Cometeer
fancy, fancy grinder.
It's not a blind tasting today
because it's gonna be,
well, I think pretty obvious between them,
and so I just want to taste the difference
and talk about the kind
of flavors involved.
So as we taste this one here,
it's just rough, do you know what I mean?
It's just harsh, it's
bitter, it's astringent,
it's mean, there's not
much sweetness at all.
That's not a great cup of coffee at all.
In the middle, the big
thing that you notice
is this improvement in sweetness
and this decrease in bitterness.
It's definitely a significantly
better tasting cup of coffee,
like there's a big leap there in quality.
It's a night and day difference.
Now when you get to the third bowl,
it feels definitely
like there's a little drop in extraction.
It feels lighter, but it feels very sweet.
It feels very clean.
It doesn't leave any
unpleasant finish in there,
it's just sweet and gentle.
I would want, in a way,
this but a little bit finer
to just pull the extraction
up a little bit more.
But you would guess then
that the grind distribution
on this isn't very good,
because it tastes like
it's muddy and it's harsh,
which probably means fines.
This tastes much better,
and this just tastes
very clean, very sweet.
There's probably a big variance
in the distribution of grinds.
Now the fun thing about being here
is that I don't have to just speculate.
This is a very subjective experience
and I could tell you anything
and you can't really know,
but I can show you something objective.
'Cause not only do they have
a very fancy grinder here,
they've got something I really want,
a laser particle size analyzer.
You put ground coffee in,
it uses lasers to analyze the
distribution of particles.
How many pieces are this big, that big,
all that kind of stuff.
So I'm gonna go and look
at these with Alex Kaplan,
he's Cometeer's head of coffee product,
and he's gonna talk me through
what the analysis of
these grinders looks like.
What are we seeing here?
Just talk me through the chart.

- So this first graph we're looking at
  is the volume density chart
  as a percentage of the overall grounds
  for the three different grinders.
  The red line here is the $50 grinder,
  the green line is the $500 grinder,
  and the blue line is
  Cometeer's $500,000 grinder.
  And we can clearly see a taller peak
  and a tighter distribution for
  the higher quality grinders.
  Towards the left here
  are smaller particles
  and towards the right
  are larger particles,
  and we can see that the cheaper grinder
  is making more large particles
  and more fine particles,
  and fewer of the target size.
- So a classic poor distribution.
  Show me another thing.
- [Alex] So what we see here
  is the surface area distribution
  of the three different grinders.
  So this peak towards the right
  is our target coffee ground size.
  As we get towards this first peak,
  that's the contribution of
  surface area due to fines,
  and we see that the cheaper coffee grinder
  is making much more fines
  and fewer of the target particles again.
- One other point,
  I do want to just talk about
  the Baratza just quickly.
  It's doing okay!
- [Alex] Absolutely, I'm very
  impressed by the Baratza,
  and it's interesting to me
  that it's about halfway
  between, on this scale,
  the really high quality grinder
  and the really cheap grinder.
- If you're curious how
  that big grinder tastes,
  if you want to check out Cometeer,
  there's a link in the
  description down below.
  It's not an affiliate link,
  but you should probably treat it
  just like an affiliate
  link, just so you know.
  So now it's time for a speed test,
  because I feel like speed is a big deal.
  With any piece of equipment,
  the more efficient it
  is, the faster it goes,
  the better it must be, right?
  So we're gonna grind with
  each of these two grinders
  30 grams of coffee,
  and we're gonna time it
  and see how fast they are.
  Let's do that now.
  (coffee beans tinkling)
  (machine grinding)
  20 seconds, not bad.
  Let's try the Baratza.
  (coffee beans tinkling)
  (machine grinding)
  All right.
  A little bit slower.
  So if you reverse engineer the maths,
  this will do, at this
  particular grind setting,
  about 90 grams a minute.
  This one, a little bit less,
  maybe like 75 grams a second,
  I'll do the actual maths and
  put it underneath me now,
  but that's around it.
  Let's compare that
  to something much, much,
  much more expensive.
  To do that, we can't just
  grind 30 grams of coffee,
  we need to grind a lot more.
  With a roller mill, it's
  impossible to grind that much
  and have any idea how long it took.
  We're gonna need to
  grind 30 kilos of coffee.
  Let's see how fast that thing is.
  So we're back on the
  production floor again,
  because it's time for the speed test.
  I'm gonna load the big, big,
  fancy grinder with coffee.
  We're gonna grind 30 kilos here.
  I'm gonna load some coffee.
  (coffee beans pouring)
  (machinery humming)
- 60 Seconds.
- Thank you!
  Okay, so the roller
  mill, the fancy grinder,
  30 kilos per minute,
  which is a lot more
  than 90 grams a minute.
  It's not like a thousand times more,
  but it's close, you know what I mean?
  I feel like in this particular case,
  you really get what you pay
  for in terms of productivity.
  Now you'll have noticed that
  I was thrown a bag of coffee,
  because I overheard
  something as we were talking
  that was kind of interesting.
  And that's the idea
  that with a roller mill,
  you can do something really cool,
  that you can change the shape
  of that distribution curve.
  It's not just about moving
  the peak up or down,
  you can move other parts of the curve
  to shape the distribution
  of coffee any way you want.
  So as part of that speed test,
  we also had them, very kindly agree,
  to adjust the grinder very slightly.
  I don't know quite what they're doing,
  they're never gonna
  tell me this fun stuff,
  probably moving one or two of
  the rollers to change things,
  and then we get an outcome.
  Let's go and see what changed.
  So we've now got the two charts,
  the original grinds from the roller mill
  and then the tweaked kind
  of shape curve, right?
  What's changed?
- [Alex] So we can see a few changes here.
  The first on this volume density graph
  is that the new curve here in green
  is much finer as a peak.
  So we're able to change that target size
  with a lot of precision.
  And then you can also
  see the shape on the tail
  is quite different,
  where there's a slight hump
  around this 50 micron size.
  So we're able to augment
  not only our target,
  but the rest of the distribution as well.
- How does this look in
  the kind of other charts
  that show surface area?
- [Alex] So here, if we pull it up,
  we can see some interesting
  data on the fines
  for the two surface area curves.
  So what we can see is
  the old graph in blue
  and the new one in green,
  that as we saw before, the
  total peak of the target size
  is shifted finer to the left there,
  but in addition, there
  are fewer overall fines,
  which you can see from the smaller peak
  in that fine size class.
- So you can kinda make one grinder
  act like a number of
  different grinders in a way.
  I think people assume that
  a grinder and a burr set
  produces a result, a distribution,
  and this sort of says,
  if you have enough toys,
  you can play with that and
  you have sort of freedom
  to detach your fines from your targets
  and play with each of those things.
  So what do we learn?
  What do we take away
  from all of this stuff?
  I think that the takeaway here
  is a beautiful expression of
  kind of diminishing returns.
  Spending $50 on a coffee
  grinder is probably better
  than buying a bunch of
  certain pre-grounds,
  but it's not great.
  But, and I'm not saying
  you have to spend 500,
  but by the time you've spent 500,
  you've had such an incredible
  improvement in cup quality,
  and I would say it's kind of
  linear at that point, right?
  Spending 100 will be kind
  of twice as good as this,
  but above $500, for someone at home,
  it really is a world
  of diminishing returns.
  I think it's really
  cool how far you can go.
  And if you're interested
  in kind of pushing
  coffee in a certain place
  and getting the most out of it,
  I'm glad the technology exists,
  but you can sort of see it on a chart.
  You know, like the jump in price
  for a thousand times more than this,
  yeah, you can see what
  you get for your money.
  Now you might ask at
  $500,000, is it worth it?
  Well, I think it is,
  if you're trying to do
  incredible brewing at mass scale,
  then yeah, it absolutely is worth it.
  Is it worth it for you
  to be saving your pennies
  and not buying a house and
  instead buying a grinder?
  Well, maybe not.
  I have to say, I said at the start,
  this video has been on my list for years,
  it's been kind of like
  a bucket list video.
  I am totally satisfied
  by what we have learned
  and looked at and discovered today.
  I am pleased, it's kind of amazing
  just to see it laid out
  in graphs, in the cup,
  I think that's just been super cool.
  But now I want to hear from you.
  Was this interesting?
  Did you learn a bunch about
  how good coffee grinders
  can be at the very top end?
  Was that kind of revelatory to you?
  Is it what you expected to them to do?
  It was definitely a surprise for me.
  Let me know down in the comments below.
  But for now, I'll say thank
  you so much for watching,
  and I hope you have a great day.
