## The Best Espresso Machine Under £1,500

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0kQ5WqjcU8&t=1490s>

Welcome to today's video.
Today, we're going to be looking
for the best espresso machine under £1500.
Now in the past, we've done
under £100, under £500.
There wasn't actually a
lot at the £1000 point
so we jumped all the way to 1500
and if you haven't seen
those other videos,
they'll be up here and in the description.
Check 'em out too if you're shopping
for a new espresso machine.
Now, these machines were picked
through a poll of my Patreon supporters.
There's lots of choices
but these are, I think,
a great selection of what's out there.
They're all pretty available worldwide,
they're all very popular
choices and I can't wait
to see how they stack
up against one another.
Let me walk you through
what we've got here and what they cost.
First up is the Lelit MaraX.
This is the cheapest
of the machines at £999
so just scraping in under £1,000
then we have the Rocket Appartamento,
another popular choice at £1,225.
Next up is the Profitec Pro 500,
the most expensive machine today at £1,399
and then we move into the
Rancilio Silvia Pro, £1,320,
and on the end, the Sage or
Breville Dual Boiler at £1,199.
These three machines, all
heat exchanger machines.
They have a single boiler
inside them that produces steam
and very hot water and
that heat is exchanged
into brew water on its way to the group.
They have what are called
E61 style group heads
where you control the machine
with a little lever on the front.
If you lift it up a little bit,
it will allow water to
flow from the group head,
lift it all the way
and it engages the pump
and you will get your
nine bars of pressure.
This technology is named
after the E61 released in 1961 by Faema
and it's still a very
popular technology today.
These two machines are
both dual boiler technology
where you have a separate boiler
to heat your brewing water
and then a boiler just
for steam and hot water,
you might want to take off for tea
or an Americano or something like that.
Generally speaking, you know
you can control the temperature
of your brew water independently
of your steam pressure
with a dual boiler so if you
want a hotter brew temperature,
you don't have to increase
your steam pressure
or vice versa, you can have
cooler brew temperature
without losing steam power.
Here, with the heat exchanger,
your brew temperature
and your steam pressure are interlinked
so if you want a cooler brew temp,
you lose steam pressure
as your kind of trade-off.
Now these machines will be
used sort of factory set.
I've not opened to the
inside of them up at all.
Anything that I've changed
would be changed through programming.
I might have changed
their brew temperature
through a control on
the front of the machine
but I'm not going to
get inside them at all
because that's not really
the point of this today.
One other quick change,
they're all going to use the same basket.
I've taken their stock baskets out
for the sake of sort of ease,
they're all using a VST 18 gram basket
when I come to do shot tests
and that kind of stuff,
it just makes evaluating the
machine that little bit easier.
I would say in almost every case,
I would get rid of the
stock basket and replace it
with a VST or similar pretty
early on so that's what I did.
Otherwise, they are as
stock sort of factory set.
Here's how the review is going to work,
we're going to break it
down into some sections.
Firstly, we're going to
talk through the build
and the aesthetics and
some of the features
of each of the machines then
we'll talk a little bit more
about sort of brewing espresso
with each of these machines,
how they perform, how the shots taste,
then we'll do a little bit
of steaming tests, right?
How quickly do they steam milk?
Do they produce a good texture?
And at the end of all of that,
I'll come back here, I'll wrap up,
and I'll tell you which
one I think is the best.
So let's start with the
Rocket Appartamento,
the first of the heat exchangers,
the E61 machines, and
talk about how it looks.
And I think of the machines here,
actually it looks pretty good.
I like the detailing that they
have on the side panel here,
I think that gives the
machine some character.
I think sort of size-wise,
feel-wise, it feels compact,
doesn't feel too big
but it also doesn't feel
particularly cluttered in that regard.
Obviously, there's a lot
of stainless steel here
and that is good from a sort
of premium feel perspective,
bad from a fingerprint
and polishing perspective,
there's a lot to keep clean here,
but it does feel solid,
substantial and well-made.
I'll say also as a little
detail, I quite like the feet,
they've done a good job here.
Feet are not always done
well, I quite like the feet.
Styling-wise, you know,
with the E61 machines,
there's a lot of similarities.
The little details
around the steam wand
valve are kind of nice.
Now, let's talk about the kind
of usability piece of it as well.
And I'll start with a little bit
of a weird complaint and
that is the portafilter.
The portafilter comes with some
spouts in a weird position.
I really don't like it
when you have spouts
facing forwards like this,
they should be to the back.
Now what's weird in the manual,
they appear in both configurations,
sort of spouts fronts,
spouts back, I dunno.
I also don't particularly
like the little shield cover-y
bits that they put on here.
It just makes a really
important piece harder to clean.
So this just annoys me,
it's clearly supposed
to be this way, it shows it
this way round in the manual
but it's just, it's just wrong.
It makes you push the cups right
to the back and I just don't like it.
As for the rest of the machine, well,
there's not actually that
much you interact with.
You have a very standard
E61 control lever,
you know, you have an open position
that allows liquid to pass through,
you lift to engage the
pump and close again
and that's your primary
point of interaction
and with all of the
heat exchanger machines,
it's the same point of interaction.
It is a little cluttered.
Right at the back here,
you've got your hot water tap
and spout, it's not, I don't like it.
It's just cluttered in here,
it's not nice from the
usability perspective,
tons of space on the
side for the steam wand.
Beyond that, well there aren't
really any other controls
that you're supposed to interact with.
With this machine, you have no direct way
of controlling the temperature
of the steam boiler
which therefore impacts the temperature
of your brew water
through the heat exchange
so you kind of get what you're given.
Similarly pressure from
the vibration pump.
Yes, there's an over pressure valve
but to adjust that involves,
you know, getting inside the machine
and doing some maintenance work
that technically would
invalidate your warranty.
It's not really a consumer-facing
part of the machine,
something you can change or adjust easily.
So really it's kind of
on-off, open or closed,
that's your interaction with this machine
and from the simplicity
perspective, that's not bad.
I don't mind a simple machine
but a little bit more control
would be desirable, especially
at this price point.
One more piece of usability
and this will come up again
and again with the heat exchanger machines
in particular, it's heat up time.
This is at least a 30 minute heat up time
to have everything fully up to temperature
and that's a long time.
It's a machine where I would want
to have it come on in an automated way
well in advance of me
wanting to make coffee.
If I get up, I want coffee and then I have
to go and switch it
on, that's frustrating.
That's too long a time
between desire for
coffee and getting coffee
so the 30 plus minute heat up time
for me is a bit of a negative.
Last thing to talk about
before we sort of talk about,
you know, the next
machine and then we talk
about making coffee later is gauges.
This has just one, this
has a steam pressure gauge
and that's it, you really
don't know what's going on
with things like pump pressure,
you just know how hot your steam boiler is
and you can sort of deduct-ish,
are you at temperature
for your brew boiler?
But really there's not a lot of insight
into what's happening in the machine,
especially when you're brewing.
One nice feature though
increasingly common across the machines,
it is a cool touch steam wand.
(steam hisses)
So from a safety perspective,
that's kind of nice,
though obviously the very
tip here does get very hot.
So the Lelit MaraX is the
smallest of the footprints
of the machines we have here today
and that is very likable, right?
The more you can get
into a smaller footprint,
frankly the better.
What's interesting to me is
where it doesn't compromise, right?
It's no more kind of cluttered
around the group head
than any of the other
heat exchanger machines.
It still suffers the same level of clutter
where your brew activating lever is close
to your hot water tap but it
feels like the other machines
are just wider past these points,
rather than having these
things further away
in a kind of notable way anyway.
So tons of stainless
steel, feels well-made,
well-built, looks relatively neat.
I won't say it's proportions
are truly aesthetically
pleasing, something about it
just feels a bit disproportionate
in a funny sort of way.
It doesn't feel, maybe
it's just a bit too tall,
I can't quite work it out
but it doesn't kind of feel quite balanced
in its design but that's
a very personal thing
so you may feel totally different to me.
What it doesn't do well
is feet, it has bad feet.
Very small little rubber feet under here.
It's almost impossible
to get your fingers
underneath the machine.
If you want to lift it and move it,
that's extremely awkward.
Don't drag it, which I did.
The little rubber feet pop off
at the back and that's kind of annoying
but once it's in place,
you should be fine, right?
From a sort of user interface perspective,
you have a couple of lights.
You've got a up to
temperature or a heating light
and you've got a hot water level light,
let you know if your tanks running empty
or if your machine is heating up,
obviously your main power switch.
There is one more switch.
(drip tray rattles)
And we'll talk about the
drip tray in a second.
Under here, there's a switch
with three positional
settings, zero, one and two,
and that's for low, medium
and high temperatures.
It being a heat exchanger,
this temperature setting
for your brew temperature will
impact your steam pressure
so know that going to
the highest temperature
will yield very high pressures of steam,
thing to bear in mind.
In my testing, the low temperature seemed
to be in the region of
sort of 85 to 87, maybe 88,
and the high temperature roundabout 92
with a little variation depending
on how you were using it,
how you were flushing
it, that kind of a thing.
If I was brewing lighter roasts,
I would want to be at high.
If I was brewing medium to dark roast,
I would want to be at
medium to low temperatures.
So I like that, you know,
there is some control
of a brew temperature.
It's a little simplistic,
it's a little brute force,
but ultimately, truth be told,
I think the changes you would need to make
to brew temperature to see a
substantial impact on flavor
also need to be pretty brute
force, pretty big changes
so I don't actually have
a problem with that.
I dislike the lack of transparency
in terms of what exactly am I doing?
What am I getting?
But as a solution, you know,
for the money, it's not bad.
Now we do have to talk
about the portafilter design
for the Lelit 'cause it is very strange.
You'll see here the splitter
on this portafilter is an unusual shape.
Now the upside is that as you're brewing,
the espresso kind of
falls out towards you.
The downside is you've
added quite a long path
of travel in the portafilter,
I don't think for really
much in the way of a benefit.
It's more to clean, it's not
particularly easy to clean.
I just find it a kind of weird design.
I suspect some people really like it,
I just find it a bit odd
but as with the other heat exchangers,
that's the sort of beginning and end
of your interaction with the machine.
You've got your two valves,
your steam and your hot
water, and your brew lever
and that's really day to day.
how you're going to
interact with this thing,
how you're going to use it.
On top, there's a little
space on your cup warmer
for some cups, as many as you
might need at home I suspect,
so for me, while it is a compact machine,
that's enough space on top
for me to be pretty happy.
From an information perspective,
last thing to note is that this machine
does have two gauges which is good.
You have a steam pressure gauge
and you have a brew pressure gauge.
The brew pressure gauge
is kind of interesting,
in that it seems to show
you a little bit more
of what's happening
inside the brew chamber
than other brew pressure gauges often do.
Often, you would put a Scace in
and you would see nine bars on a gauge
and maybe eight bars in the group head.
Here, what you see on the gauge
is much closer to what
you see on the Scace gauge
which is kind of interesting.
This running a little high for me,
higher than I would want based
on this sort of information,
I would want the gauge to
show more like eight bars
and again, it's an OPV so you're going
to go in and do sort of the hard work
of adjusting an over-pressure valve
that is awkward and frustrating
to get exactly what you want
so from that point of
view, a little annoying,
but to have the information
is kind of nice.
And as you'll note as
we talk about espresso
in a little bit, the way it comes up
to pressure is kind of interesting too.
Anyway, that's the interaction
with the Lelit MaraX.
So the Rancilio Silvia Pro,
obviously based on the very
popular Rancilio Silvia,
probably the most modified domestic
espresso machine in the world.
I suspect there's more PID kits running
on Rancilio Silvias than anything else
and this feels like a response to that.
You know, the users were
fixing aspects of a machine,
Rancilio fixed it themselves.
So they did a dual boiler, this is it
and it's a lot like it's just
a lot, it feels very big.
As a machine, it does feel like it lacks
just a little bit in the way of elegance.
It feels like a kind of
brute force solution here
and that's from the size and
the shape kind of throughout.
Now I have a couple of little complaints
on the sort of user
experience side of things,
some things that quite make sense to me.
There are things that I like though.
But let's start with the
rocker switches on the front.
Now these are similar than
you would find in the Silvia.
They don't act in a uniform way
and that kind of bothers me.
The main on-off switch as you'll see,
it's off, it's on, up and down,
that's how a rocker switch works.
All the other switches
don't do that, they bounce.
Now the rocker switch I just
hit is the steam function
and on a Rancilio Silvia,
on a normal Rancilio Silvia,
that heats the machine up to
a sort of higher temperature
so you can get steam out of it.
Here, it just turns off the steam boiler,
which is kind of
interesting as a solution.
You know, if you don't want to steam milk,
then don't heat up a steam boiler.
You've got a dual boiler,
you can just heat the coffee boiler.
I think that's a nice touch,
though it's kind of a
weird use of a button
that has an existing
kind of design language
in coffee machines, I don't
know, it's just kind of weird.
Same again actually with
the shot button, right?
If you start to pull a shot,
if you turn it on, it bounces back up.
Obviously you can hear
the machine is running.
(machine whirs)
But why doesn't the button stay down?
Just stay down, be on or off.
I just find it a really weird
behavior for the switches.
On here, you do have your control box.
Again, it's not hidden the way it is
in other machines, it's front and center.
The upside of that is that it works
as a shot timer while you're pulling shots
so that's a nice use of that,
otherwise it shows you
the live temperature
of the boiler of the machine.
There are more functions in here,
they're not hugely
intuitive in my experience.
Like there is a sort of program
to shut down and wake up
but you're programming how many hours
until the machine wakes up again.
You don't program a clock
and say wake up at 7:00 AM,
you say, wake up in 23 hours or something.
I find that a little odd,
a kind of reasonable usage of a key pad
to do a little bit more in terms
of functionality but I don't think
that's superb user interface
design if I'm totally honest.
My only other real significant complaints
around this side of stuff is
around the drip tray actually
and this there's two things.
They've kind of brute
forced another solution
which is you can change the
height of the drip tray.
In here, there are
these pieces on the side
that sort of vaguely lock into place
with little locking wheels
and you can change the height of them.
(machine parts rattle)
Let me just do this now.
Oh, there we go, so let's
drop it all the way down
and now my drip tray will sit lower
when I put it back on there, right?
Little bit lower down.
It works, okay, I don't think
it's a particularly elegant
design if I'm honest, right?
Like it's a little bit
brute forced in a way,
like it works, it's okay,
it's kind of useful I guess.
Again, if you were using this
as a pure espresso machine,
you would want this higher up you know,
you don't need to put a big mug underneath
but if you're doing a big
milk drink, that's an option.
That's a smaller complaint
than my larger complaint
which is the decision to
put a lip here, right?
Because you can't see how
full the actual drain tray is
underneath the drip tray grid here, right?
So if it got very full, you wouldn't see
until it was potentially too
late and if it was very full,
you've got a problem because I can't,
you know, gingerly slide
this out, I have to lift it.
I have to lift it up to
that angle to get it out
and if that's full, that's
going to make a terrible mess.
That is a really weird
design choice to me.
I do not understand it,
it's incredibly frustrating.
I think it's a bad design
decision if I'm honest
because I could foresee someone
making a terrible mess
of their kitchen counter
by accidentally having
a very full drip tray
and trying to find a way to get it out.
You can't just lift it straight up
'cause it's stuck underneath here.
Very frustrating.
So let's have a little look
at the Profitec Pro 500
and it is our most expensive machine.
And if you look at it, it's
a lot of stainless steel,
it's a lot of uninterrupted, shiny,
fingerprint-attracting stainless steel.
I think it looks quite nice.
I think the build is quite
nice, it's quite boxy
and if that's your vibe
then you're probably
really quite into this but yeah,
it feels substantial, it feels spacious.
It feels the closest to a kind
of pro machine in some ways,
certainly of the three E61 style machines.
Few things to talk about
in terms of the externals.
Firstly, the water tank sits
underneath this entire tray, right?
So you need to lift off your
cups and everything else
to sort of get into your water tank.
It makes for a bigger cup warming tray,
a more functional cup warming tray,
but it is also just a bit
weird as an experience.
I'll say it again, I've
said it lots of times;
from a user perspective, the
clutter around the brew handle
and the hot water tap is the same,
it's the same frustration.
There's a little bit more
space between these two valves,
there's a little bit
more width to the machine
but it's a centimeter or
two compared to the others
so it's still relatively crowded.
Now the Profitec being the most expensive,
it is, of the heat exchangers,
the most feature-rich so on the front,
you can see you've got
your steam pressure gauge,
you've got your brew pressure
gauge so that's nice.
Both are there, that's good,
and then if you pull the drip tray out,
here underneath, you've got
your control for temperature.
Now, as we've talked about
before with a heat exchanger,
you're controlling the
temperature of the steam boiler
so 126 degrees Celsius seems very high,
obviously that's for
steam and you'll lose heat
in the heat exchange process
so this is to produce, I think,
somewhere in the region of like 94,
95 degrees Celsius, which it mostly does.
Programing this as an
experience isn't lovely.
I feel like it's slightly
convoluted as a menu
and not particularly
intuitive but it works fine.
They could have done the work in terms
of giving you the option to
just see your brew temperature
and change that and
algorithmically have them
do the backend work of
converting your desired brew temp
to the correct steam boiler temperature.
This is a little bit more simplistic
and I think that's kind
of a shame for the money,
like I don't care what my
steam water temperature is,
I care about my brew boiler
and I know it's not a direct correlation
and you can't just offset it but still,
that's not complicated
maths, I don't think.
That aside, it is nice
to still have control
over your temperatures and in your manual,
and don't lose that,
you would have a chart
giving you the sort of conversion
of steam temp to brew temp.
Similar to the other machines,
heat up times are very
long, changes in temperature
sort of coming through
have been quite slow
so again, it's one
you'd want it on a timer
in order to have this be hot
and ready to go, you know,
turning on 30 to 40 minutes
before you want to make coffee.
Again, it's a frustrating
aspect of the user experience
of these kind of machines.
Feet, reasonable feet,
certainly easy enough to move,
lift up, deal with that kind of stuff.
Not beautiful but certainly adequate.
One quick note before we get
into actually pulling a shot
and talking about
temperatures and pressures,
I did have the single incidence
of thermosiphon stall with this machine.
Now I don't want to go too deep into this,
it can happen to any
heat exchanger machine.
It's when the water stops cycling
in the thermosiphon properly
and your group head goes relatively cool.
You need that movement of
water happening constantly
to maintain a temperature here.
That didn't happen and I was getting shots
in the sort of mid 80s in
terms of brew temperature,
flush through a bunch of water
and it seemed to correct itself.
I know other machines can suffer from this
so it's not a particular, you know,
negative for this one machine
but I do want to point out the fact
that it did happen and it can
happen with heat exchangers.
So let's talk about the Dual
Boiler from Sage or Breville,
depending where you are in the world
and I think this machine
is another great example
of their particular
approach to product design
because from a sort of
features perspective,
it crushes the competition, right?
Like on paper, the features
here exceed everyone else
and what do I mean by that?
Well, you've obviously got a dual boiler,
you've got control of your
temperature to a degree Celsius.
You've got a shot clock on here
but you've got a clock
on the machine as well
so you can program your
morning wake up or shut down
so it's always hot and
ready when you want to go.
You can program pre-infusion
in this machine,
both its duration and its pressure.
You can use this as a time-based delivery
on the pre-program buttons
or a volume based
delivery on those buttons
and I'll show you my
one tiny little feature
that I think is emblematic
of their design,
here, the little knob under the machine
and you twist it, lifts
up, oh, it moves around.
How nice is that?!
You know, it's a little
detail, but it matters.
And they do all this at what
is kind of in the middle
of the pricing for this
thing, it's about £1200.
Well, how?
And the answer, very obviously, is build.
Like these are all built out of metal,
they're heavy, they're substantial.
This...
(tapping)
Is not, you pick it up,
it feels lightweight
compared to everything else.
It doesn't feel built
with the same quality or,
quality is not quite fair,
the same kind of heaviness
and weight of materials.
It's not stainless steel everywhere,
it's not that kind of a thing.
If I was to describe
those other four machines,
I would use the phrase pro-sumer,
that's quite a common word, you know,
it's a professional consumer machine,
it's sort of in that middle ground.
This feels like a consumer machine,
feels like a very nice consumer machine
but it feels like a consumer machine.
It feels like it's targeting
a different audience.
It's the only machine that tells me,
"Don't put milk in the water tank."
I don't know what you make of that
but clearly that's happened often enough
with their products that
they needed to put it
in writing where you fill the water tank.
That just says they're
targeting a different audience
with less knowledge, less interest,
less investment in espresso
but they're still trying
to build features that appeal
to the espresso enthusiast
and that's what makes
it kind of interesting.
Now one of the frustrations is
that their portafilters are
very slightly different.
They're 58 ml portafilters
so I'm using the same basket
that I've used for all the others here,
but the little lugs on the
side here are a different size
so I cannot put my
Scace 2 into the machine
to test its pressure and to
test its brew temperature.
There's various ways
you can try and hack it,
you know, you can put a little probe
on top of a bed of coffee
and sort of sneak it in
and see what that's giving you.
It's pretty much
delivering on temperature,
I don't have any concerns there.
Pressure, I have to trust the gauge,
and the gauge is telling me
that the OPV is not set correctly.
This thing will hit comfortably
10, 11 bars while brewing,
you'll see that pressure
decline during the shot
as the sort of puck erodes
or it creates channels
in the puck and finds easier ways through
but it should never hit those
pressures in the first place.
I don't want a machine brewing
at that high of a pressure,
I want the over pressure valve
to bleed off pressures above nine bars.
I know you're probably
tired of me saying it
but I'm also tired of saying it,
like this is basics of good coffee brewing
and I'm just very annoyed in four
of the five machines tested
to be raising the same point.
Just to wrap on the sort of experience
before we pull a shot, you know,
it feels both quite
substantial and quite compact,
you know what I mean?
Like it's not a small machine,
it's not the smallest machine
but it's not particularly deep
and I think that matters
to a lot of people
and a lot of people's kitchens.
It doesn't feel as compact
as the Lelit over there,
but they've done a good job
of making it feel, you know,
a nice balance between
substantial and small enough.
You know, I don't think
the space saving stuff
about putting a tool storage tray here
is particularly useful.
I don't want to be pulling
my drip tray in and out,
but you know, they're trying
and I appreciate that.
So now, we're into talking
about making espresso
and we are back to the
Rocket Appartamento.
Now my experience with this
has been kind of mixed.
I've quite liked the
coffee coming out of here,
though it isn't brewing in a way
that I would really want it to.
Once I put a Scace device into here,
I began to understand why
and primarily it's because of pressure
so let's have a look at the brew pressure.
145 PSI on a Scace 2 means that the pump
is producing probably
something closer to 160 PSI,
that's nearly 13 bars of pressure.
I don't want to see 13 bars
of pressure at the pump,
I want to see nine bars
of pressure at the pump
and once you accommodate losses,
I want to see like 110,
115 PSI something there
on a Scace 2 like this
for a nine bar pump.
Higher than that and I will
have some additional bitterness
in my experience and a
much higher likelihood
of channeling in my shots.
That's to me unacceptable
in a factory shipped unit.
This should have been fixed at factory,
I have no idea why the
pump is running this high.
Yeah, I can mod the OPV
but I shouldn't have to.
Brew temperatures ranged
from sort of 92 to 94,
which was pretty good and they
were generally pretty stable.
Occasionally, a little slow to
recover after pulling a shot,
you know, before you get the next shot
and a little drop in
temperature but overall,
no real complaints about brew temperature.
Let's pull a shot.
(machine whirs)
Not a bad shot, you know what I mean?
It would be better at
a lower pump pressure,
I would enjoy it more and it would make
making espresso easier for me
because I'd have less issues
with things like channeling most likely
but it strikes me as a capable machine
that would need a few little
tweaks to really perform
at its best, from an
espresso brewing perspective.
Obviously, now the heat
exchangers have a shot timer
because of the nature of how you turn on
and off the grip with that kind of lever,
I suppose it could be done
but none of them have that function
so you'd want to use a scale
or something else for timing,
which from an espresso brewing perspective
is not truly ideal but
it's certainly workable
in most situations so I
would say a capable machine.
The only thing I would be aware of is
if I was brewing lots of
different styles of coffee,
I was brewing light roasts, dark roasts,
that kind of stuff, I would be frustrated
that I couldn't tune my brew temperature
around my coffees, right?
Like that would be a frustration.
Yes, you could run a different
heat exchange routine,
you could flush more water out,
cool the group head down
and try and go that way
but it's a difficult
thing to be accurate with.
I would much rather have a machine
where I could program
my desired temperature
and have the machine take
care of the difficult stuff.
Good shots, could it be
better with a little tweak
but certainly capable as a
machine and for, you know,
producing great espresso.
So pulling shots with the
Lelit, interesting experience.
Let's have a look at
brew pressure quickly.
(machine whirs)
Now this is a really
slow ramp up to pressure.
(steam hisses)
Now you can see on the gauge
here, just above nine bars
and here, just above nine bars here too.
Now, you know, based on this,
it's running about a bar and a half higher
than I would want it to
run but it's interesting
to see the similarities
between the two gauges,
that is definitely interesting.
So brew temperature wise, as we said,
generally it's been around
92, give or take a degree-ish.
Certainly for me, a nice
place to be brewing espresso
and it's performed
actually quite consistently
shot to shot which I
have liked about this.
Let's make an espresso now.
(machine whirs)
The espresso has been very good,
brew temperature is good,
brew pressure has been high,
and you can taste that, again,
it's that same sort of thing
where you have this
additional kind of layer
of bitterness that you
don't necessarily want
or shouldn't really be there.
Having this very slow ramp up to pressure,
it means you can grind much finer
and you know shots have
had relatively high yields
and very good extractions
from that point of view,
potential channeling aside,
it's made nice coffee.
It's set up so the temperature is kind of
where I want it to be,
it's just frustrating
that again from factory, it's not right
in terms of pressure,
it's running too high,
it's running higher than I would want
and that really, really frustrates me.
It really annoys me.
I don't want to have to fix that problem.
It should not be on the
consumer to fix that problem.
So lots to like about this,
especially at its price point compared
to the others here but frustrating
that it lets itself down
in these little ways.
Let's talk about some good things though.
Now, this machine is unusual
when it comes to temperatures
and pressures in that it does
what it's supposed to do
right out of the box, right?
Compared to the others here,
that's kind of surprising.
You get the temperature you
expect from the gauge here
and it brews at the right pressures.
Let's have a look.
(machine whirs)
So what was kind of interesting there was
that the programming was set to 94,
93 was on the screen indicating
it was a little bit cool,
but actually brew temperature
suggests no, it was in the 94 range.
Pump pressure's about 150 in PSI,
indicating it's probably 130 PSI at pump,
nine bars, eight sort of measured
in a flowing working group
head as you would want.
So from that perspective,
it's doing what it's supposed to do
and that is shockingly surprising
at this point when it really shouldn't be.
You know, points here, it's
the temperature I want,
it's the pressure I want,
let's make some coffee.
(machine whirs)
The espresso has been very good.
It's been as good as
the coffee I've put in
and the grinder that I've
used to grind it, right?
Like a good espresso machine
should kind of become almost invisible,
it just reliably delivers the temperature
and pressure that you want.
If it's distributing water properly
onto the puck then any complaints
with the shot you have really
should be pointed elsewhere
in the whole kind of process.
So from an espresso perspective,
it is a solid performer,
I have no real complaints at all.
Stop me if you've heard this one before,
but the pressure on this
machine runs too high.
We're getting pretty much
10 bars on the gauge,
we're seeing at least
nine bars in the group,
it's at least a bar too high for me.
I don't really have a good explanation
as to why other than it just
wasn't properly set at factory.
This is going to be a theme it seems
that comes up again and again and again.
Let's make some espresso.
(machine whirs)
Now, espresso from this
has generally been good.
I have no real complaints,
the higher brew temp works for me.
The shots have tasted a
little bit high pressure-y
and I wish the pump was
running lower from factory,
that would make the shots better.
Again, it's not super difficult
to go in the back and
do an OPV adjustment,
I just don't want to have to do it.
I don't think I should
be expected to do it
to have an optimally functioning machine,
especially for this kind of money.
But overall, no real complaints.
Performance sort of
back-to-back has been okay.
You know, with all the
heat exchangers really,
if you go too hard, too much
sort of throughput for them,
they will decline in temperature
but under normal usage for homes,
I've certainly had no issue.
It's another very capable machine
but it's not necessarily
making better espresso
than any of the other heat
exchangers so to speak,
like I think they are all
making very good espresso,
relatively easily.
Now it's interesting
to look at this machine
with some context of previous
machines we've looked at.
If you go back to the
previous comparison review,
the £500 review, we had
the Breville Bambino Plus
and that felt in some ways
more advanced than this machine
with the one exception with that machine,
that you had very little
control over brew temperature
and you didn't have a 58 ml basket.
Here you do and that sort of makes it
a more espresso-focused machine
but the rest of it in
terms of how it steams
or that kind of stuff just doesn't feel
as up-to-date as that particular machine,
which just is I think worth noting.
But let's make some espresso.
(machine whirs)
So you catch the slow ramp
at seven seconds up to full pressure
so you've got seven seconds pre-infusion.
(machine whirs)
And then straight up
to 10 and a half bars.
Dropping now to nine and a half...
Dropping down to nine.
(machine whirs)
That's kind of weird.
You've seen me use this machine
on this channel a bunch
of times in the past.
It can make great espresso.
It again just bothers me
that I'm just so close
to what I want but I'm not there.
Again, the shots taste
that little bit harsher
than I would want with this
pressure configuration.
Now on the other machines here
on the sort of four pro-sumer machines,
you can see nuts and bolts and screws
and places to get into the machine
and there's a sort of subtext of
you may wish to open this
machine and get inside.
That's not how this looks and feels.
There are no screws
anywhere that you can see.
The message is do not open
me but people do and have
and they've modded these
machines and fixed OPVs
or done what's called
the Slayer pressure mod
that's not for today's video
but interesting that you
can modify this machine
in a bunch of interesting ways.
And stop me if you've
heard this one before,
I shouldn't have to do it, I
should not have to spend £1200
and then be tweaking things like pressure,
that's not the way it should be.
So I'm close to what I want.
Temperature tastes good,
I've had reliable temperature from it,
I just want to fix that pressure issue
but it's a capable machine when it comes
to brewing good espresso.
(relaxed piano and drum music)
Steaming-wise, certainly
quick enough for me.
Steam was nice and easy to work with.
It's a single whole steam tip
but certainly very easy to work with,
got some great texture,
no real problems whatsoever with steaming,
this steams very well.
Now, steaming with the MaraX
has been kind of interesting.
Now I suspect it's to do with the way
that this thing controls its temperature.
It has two temperature probes,
I presume one is in the steam boiler
and one is in the thermosiphon
and it's going to control the steam boiler
to kind of regulate the
thermosiphon temperature
and that's meant that
actually the steam pressure
during operation has varied quite a lot,
depending on what you're
doing with your brew water too
and that's been a bit
of a surprise actually,
useful to know, but a bit of a surprise.
It's meant that I've had
pretty high steam pressures
and kind of middling steam pressures.
Steaming with this is easy,
texture has been great,
like I have no complaints
about it whatsoever
but performance has varied a little bit,
depending on where the
steam boiler is sitting
and that's just kind of odd
to me, a little unusual.
I'm not sure this is really a complaint
because even at lower pressures,
I've had enough steam to get nice texture,
though I might wonder at higher pressures
if it would be more difficult to control,
just having that much more steam pressure.
Overall, no real complaints
just worth noting
that that has been a strange one.
To steam with, the Silvia Pro is lovely,
very easy, tons of
pressure, not too much flow
so you've got lots of time
to do what you need to do
but enough force in the
steam to have great texture
in that kind of churning
phase in the second half.
It doesn't steam with
the sort of aggression
of a commercial machine, it
still feels like you're steaming
on a very nice domestic machine.
Steaming with this is very nice actually.
The tip on here restricts
the steam flow enough
that you have nice pressure
but not excessive flow.
That means that you have plenty
of time to do what you need to do
in terms of texturing and
getting your sort of foam created
and then rolled around nicely.
Overall, steaming with this, very nice,
no issues at higher temperatures.
You know, I'm at 126 in the steam boiler,
about a bar and a half of pressure
but yeah, easy, easy to work with.
To steam with, super good.
Very easy, plenty of
pressure, not too much flow
so it's quite a slow
process but it's easy.
You've got time to do what you need to do,
good at steaming milk.
So let's wrap up.
I'll give you a quick
rundown of each of them,
a quick summary of each of the machines
and then I'll tell you
which one I would buy
if you gave me £1500 to spend.
At the beginning, the Lelit
MaraX I really quite liked.
It's small, it's the
cheapest of them here.
You don't get fine temperature control
but I think you get enough.
It brews pretty good espresso.
We'll not talk endlessly about pressure
but it's kind of fine.
I think it's a good value machine,
I think at the price point
it's out-competing something
like the Rocket Appartamento.
Here, I feel like this
was a difficult bracket
for this machine.
It's well-built, it looks good,
but it does not have the
feature set of a cheaper machine
or a very slightly more
expensive one, right?
It sort of sits at a difficult price point
where I'm not sure, you know,
other than maybe I've
got a great deal on it
or I have great support and after sales.
You know, that might be a reason
I would pick this over something else
but the lack of temperature control
is frustrating for me in this regard.
The Profitec Pro 500.
Of the machines, of the heat exchangers,
it's the most expensive but
I think the best performing.
Most features, most useful, most usable.
I thought this was a
very well-made machine,
I liked a lot about it,
factory pressure aside.
I wouldn't feel bad recommending this,
it is a good machine and
I think it looks nice,
it feels nice, no real complaints outside
of the whole pressure thing.
it did what it was meant to do,
it hit the temperatures, the pressures,
it was easy to use, it makes great coffee,
but the experience of it
just frustrated me at times.
The Sage, kind of the opposite.
The experience is kind of great generally,
all the features are wonderful,
I think it's a good machine.
I just wish it was doing
what I wanted it to do a little bit more.
But there's no question, if
you're just looking at features,
this destroys everything else.
It has a better interface, it
does more, it's more useful,
it's just not built the same way as these.
It doesn't feel as heavy, it
doesn't feel as long lasting,
it doesn't feel like a pro-sumer machine,
it feels very much a consumer grade thing.
And if that bothers you, that's
going to be an issue, right?
It doesn't feel like it's going
to have the longevity
of these other machines.
Now that's just a feeling,
I'm not saying it doesn't
have the longevity,
it's kind of an experiential
aspect of the machine.
When you interact with
it, it feels lightweight
in comparison to everything else.
Now, in terms of what I would recommend.
Well, firstly, if you have
one of these machines,
I'm not sure I'd recommend upgrading
to another machine from this group.
Maybe if you have a Rocket
and you're frustrated
by not being able to play
with temperature easily,
then you might consider
something like this
and upgrade but really you're not going
to see a substantial improvement
in your espresso, right?
If you've got one of these,
you've got a great capable machine.
If you get those pressures dialed in,
temperatures dialed in,
you are very capable
of producing incredibly good espresso
if you've got a good grind.
However, to answer the question
of which would I buy with £1500,
I would be torn between these two.
I know this made better espresso
and I'm not going to discount that fact,
this did a really good job.
The user experience of
these is a little bit nicer.
They're a little bit
more attractive looking
and depending on lifestyle and
how I want to make espresso,
these would be my pick but it's tough.
And in truth, I'm a little disappointed
across the entire
bracket by the experience
on offer at the price point.
Now I know I often have
more expensive equipment
on here, right?
I have, you know, £3,000, £5,000 machines
and so is this unfair of me
to have higher expectations
of these at a lower price point?
But the thing that bothers me is
that the same components
could do a better job
if they were set up properly.
And if that were the case,
if they were all brewing
beautifully from factory,
oh, then I would really
be torn between these two
and it would be a difficult decision
and it would be about after sales
or getting a deal or
who am I buying it from?
What support will I get?
You know, that kind of stuff,
that would probably tip me over
the edge one way or another
or which one fit better into my kitchen.
But that's my feeling.
Now I'd like to hear from you
down in the comments below.
Do you have one of these?
Did I miss an aspect of one of them
that you think is worth talking about?
Share it down in the comments below.
Do you know why all of
these machines are not set
to the correct pressure
except for this one?
Am I missing something?
Am I unfairly angry about this?
Is there a really obvious
reason that I just don't get,
other than they just
weren't set up properly?
Let me know down in the comments below
and if I've made a huge mistake,
I will most definitely
publish a retraction
but I will say I'm
frustrated but I'm curious,
I'd love to hear your
thoughts, your comments.
Did we miss a machine?
I don't know, I don't get
to keep these machines.
These go to my Patreon supporters
who help me with this channel,
allow me to go out and buy
these things like a consumer
and tell you my honest
thoughts about them.
I look forward to your
feedback on this video
but for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching
