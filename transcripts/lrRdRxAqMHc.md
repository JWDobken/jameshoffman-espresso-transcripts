## How To Brew Better Dark Roasts

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrRdRxAqMHc&t=250s>

Come to today's video all about brewing
better dark roasts as filter coffee.
We're not really going to
touch on espresso today.
Just brewed coffee,
how to make it more delicious
when you're starting
with a darker roast.
Now, historically this
channel hasn't talked
about dark roasts.
It's talked about light roasts
most of the time, and that's
because within this sort
of specialty coffee world,
people tend to gravitate
towards lighter roasts
because you tend to see
more kind of taste of place.
More of the origin characteristics
in a coffee that is lighter roasted.
It'll have more floral or
fruity kind of qualities.
It'll often be a little bit more aromatic.
It may be a little bit more sweet
but it will often be much
more acidic as a result.
Now, when you roast coffee,
the longer you roast coffee,
the more you will sort
of degrade that acidity.
The more it will decline, but
the longer you roast coffee
the more bitterness
you typically will get.
This happens in loads of other things,
the most obvious being caramels
that starts as very sweet.
The darker you take it,
the more bitter it becomes,
the less sweet it becomes.
But take it too far and you've burnt it
and it just tastes bad,
be that caramel, be that coffee.
So in this video, I'm not going
to be advocating for coffee
taken all the way to pretty
much burned or kind of charcoal
you know, at that point,
that is a thing that you see.
I'm not a huge advocate
for that in any way.
By darker roasts, what I typically mean,
especially when talking
about filter coffee
is that the coffee is taken probably
to the point where you're
beginning to see oils
on the surface of the bean.
During roasting a lot
of pressure builds up
inside a coffee bean, initially
that will cause it to pop
or crack relatively early in the process.
And as you keep roasting
it, it can happen again.
There can be a second crack,
a second release of pressure
but all of that time,
this internal pressure
in the bean is pushing oils to the surface
which is why darker roasts look
much oilier on the outside.
Now I will say right now,
one of the challenges
of darker roasts is that this process
of pushing oil to the surface, this longer
roasting process gives you
a more porous coffee bean.
You can feel that when you
crush them in your fingers.
It's much easier to
crush a dark roasted bean
than a light roasted one.
Being more porous exposes it to more air
and ultimately dark roasted
coffee will stale much faster.
So this brings us actually
to tip number one.
Pay attention to
freshness, more than ever.
With lighter roasted coffees
you'll typically see
recommendations of buy it as freshly
as you can, let it
de-gas for maybe a week.
And then you've got, well
somewhere between three
and six weeks is the kind of typical range
of recommendations in
which to drink the coffee
in which it will taste good.
Darker roasts everything
is a bit accelerated.
They'll de gas faster but
they'll also have generated
more CO2 in the roasting process.
So they still do need
and still do benefit from
a little bit of resting.
However, once you start to brew,
you'll begin to notice stale flavors much,
much sooner than you would
do with lighter roasts.
So I would say you really
want to be using it
within two, three weeks, sort of maximum,
if you want the best possible experience.
I's still perfectly
drinkable beyond that point
but you're not necessarily
getting what you
paid your good money
for in terms of flavor.
Now, in making this video,
I had to think about
who is this video for?
And I think there are two groups
of people who would benefit
from what we're going to talk about today.
Group one are people that
drink dark roasted filter
coffee every day and I
want them to enjoy it
a little bit more
because I want everyone to
enjoy coffee a little bit more.
And then there's group two,
people who don't really
like the taste of dark roasted
coffee as filtered coffee
but might be stuck with nothing
else to brew and wondering
how do I get the best out of this?
Now I'm working on the idea
that you both want the same thing,
you want as much complexity
as possible from the coffee,
as little bitterness as
possible from the coffee,
you want texture, you want
body, you want mouthfeel
and you want it to be as
enjoyable as it can be.
Now, bitterness is a
complex subject in coffee.
A lot of people really dislike bitterness
but they prefer dark roasts
because they really,
really dislike acidity.
And I understand that,
having an acidic cup
of coffee to many people is a kind
of revolting idea or a
very unpleasant idea.
They've learned that the
taste of coffee is typically
more bitter and so often that's
dosed with a little dairy
or a little bit of sugar
to soften the bitterness,
to hide the bitterness a little bit.
And that's the kind of benchmark
of how coffee tastes for them.
And again, I'm trying to
make coffee taste good.
So even if you're putting
cream or sugar into it,
it tastes that little bit more enjoyable,
that little bit more pleasurable.
But if you do want to explore coffee
with less of those things in it
because it doesn't need them
because it is less bitter,
then it should be a welcoming
and interesting cup,
if you start to drop the sugar, maybe
or try it with a little less
cream or no cream one day
just to see what you think,
see what the coffee itself tastes like.
So now it's time to talk
about brewing coffee
and I'm going to recommend
with a pour over using a paper filter.
Now, if you'd like a French press,
if you'd like that sort of
sediment thing, go with it.
If that's your actual
preference, then keep doing that.
But if it's not, if you just
want to reduce bitterness
then I would recommend paper filters.
The reason they work is that
they don't let any tiny pieces
of coffee through into the brew.
Those tiny pieces do taste bitterness.
They add an extra layer
of bitterness to the cup.
So removing it does remove
some bitterness from the brew
right at the start.
A lot of people, I
think like Chemex papers
in particular for this,
they're much thicker papers.
They're two to three times heavier
than say a V60 paper, but a V60 paper,
in my experience, works
well enough to capture all
the bits and pieces and leave
you with a nice clean cup.
Now, the coffee that we're
using today is relatively dark
for filter coffee. You can
see there is a little bit
of oil coming to the surface.
They're getting that kind of sheen,
over time these would get oilier.
So when it comes to brewing,
the first thing we'll
talk about is grind size.
Now, when you roast a coffee darker,
it's easier to extract that coffee.
Confusingly, there's less
stuff to extract, you know
as you roast coffee, more and more
of it comes away as either
smoke or other things
and it kind of disappears.
There's less soluble material
in darker roasted coffee
than there isn't lighter roasted coffee
but it's more soluble,
what's left is easier to get.
So I would recommend you
grinding notably coarser
for a darker roast than a lighter roast.
I'll show you on screen now a comparison
between where I would grind for say a V60
of a light roast versus
a V60 of a dark roast.
Now this gets us immediately
into a slightly confusing topic
which is that of extraction.
I want to reduce my extraction.
You know, I know when to
under extract the coffee.
Essentially that often
happens by, you know
not extracting the coffee evenly.
I want to do it all evenly.
I just want a little
bit less from the coffee
and again, that's where a
courser of grind comes into it.
Now because the coffee
is much more fragile
when it is ground it does
shatter and produce more fines.
It's extremely brittle.
So typically you can get more
fines with darker roasts.
You could argue that you
should sift out those fines,
that would help reduce
the bitterness of a brew.
I just, I'm not a hundred percent there
on sifting because it feels wasteful.
I end up with coffee that
I have to just throw away
and I would rather go a
different route to a better cup.
Now, if you have an
enormous amount of patience,
you can slowly feed the coffee
into your grinder rather
than throw it in all at once.
That will help reduce fines, too.
We made a video about that up here
if you want to check that out.
I'm not saying do that, it's
just a thing worth noting.
So our coffee is in.
And the second thing about the recipe
is that we're going to
use a much higher dose.
I would recommend something closer
to 70 grams per liter, rather than 60.
We are grinding coarser and
that will reduce our extraction.
And that would then reduce
the strength of the cup
which we don't necessarily want to do.
So we're going to increase the dose
to increase the strength again.
So 70 grams a liter works super well.
And then we need to talk
about brew temperature.
Now this is a slightly
complicated subject.
In the past, I've given
you broad guidelines
which is the darker the roast, the lower
the brew temperature that you want to use.
Now I've been spending some time trying
to unpick this a little bit
more, and I stand by that.
I certainly wouldn't
recommend using boiling water
you know, just off the boil
to brew this entire V60
because you'd end up with
some dominant bitterness,
a pretty harsh after taste,
a little bit of smoke there.
And that brew would definitely be improved
by dairy and sugar or a
dairy alternative and sugar
but maybe we don't have to do that.
And yes, if I just had one option
of brewing different temperatures, I'd be,
with a roast this dark,
looking at 80 to 85 as a brew temperature.
And that would produce
quite a soft, gentle brew.
But recently I've been experimenting
with trying to get a bit more complexity
in the cup while still
retaining the qualities
of that lower brew temperature.

So here's the deal.
This is kind of a technique that I've used
in the past when brewing espresso
where I've had a bit of control
over temperature and boilers
and that kind of stuff.
I've found that, same thing with espresso
where you want to pull
shots at say 80 degrees C
with dark roasts to have a
heavy bodied, full, rich,
not overly bitter cup, but
if you are able to start
with very hot water right at the beginning
just to get the extraction going
you tend to have a more
complex and interesting cup.
That's what we're going to do here.
If you're willing to do a bit of work
this is kind of interesting.
So I would say if you
start with boiling water
just for the bloom and then brew the rest
of the brew at 80 degrees
Celsius, for example, you end
up with more complexity,
but not too much bitterness,
plenty of extraction, plenty
of body, plenty of texture
but a cleaner, smoother after taste.
I would be speculating
if I was to tell you why
this was the case so know that right now.
Firstly, you'd noticed that
the bloom with 80 degree C
water and boiling water is very different.
You get a lot more de-gassing
from the coffee with water
freshly off the boil.
And you are beginning an
extraction process though.
Though, your ratio of water to
coffee is pretty inefficient
and the temperature drop is pretty rapid
as that boiling water hits
at room temperature coffee.
But it seems to me that you pull out
just a little bit more in that phase,
but in the remainder of
the brew at 80 degrees C
you don't really extract
those harsh bitter things
that need higher temperatures
to get out into your brew.
Now, if this seems impractical,
then I would agree to some
extent it is, though it's not
the end of the world.
If you have a temperature control kettle
then this isn't too difficult.
What are you going to do is
take about half to two thirds
of the water that you'll need
and you'll bring that
up to the boiling point
and you'll pour what
you need for the bloom.
Put it back on the stand,
change your target temperature,
add cold water, enough
to drop the temperature
below your target and
then let it come up to 80.
That can comfortably be
done in the 45 seconds
that I would recommend
blooming the coffee for.
Now because you're brewing
with coarser ground coffee,
do expect a faster
overall brew time as well.
And so what you end up with,
I think is a brew that plays
to the strengths of the coffee.
At that darker roast,
it has a higher capacity
for body and texture and
richness and we should work
with that, use that.
It has reduced acidity
and that means we can play
with a lower extraction level
without throwing the cup out of balance.
But it can reduce the
bitterness, the harshness of that
and end up with something very tasty
if you like more developed flavors.
And if you don't, then I
think it's not so far away
from the kind of coffees that you enjoy
that you have to completely cover it
with dairy or sugar or
something to kind of mask
the things that you really dislike.
What you end up with is a
very friendly cup of coffee.
And ultimately for me, the
goal here is that people
as a whole, drink and enjoy
coffee and value coffee more.
I would rather people
were drinking dark roasts
from great producers, great
green coffees, you know
that have been roasted away
that maybe I don't love
but I still love that they drank those
than drank dark roast
of lower quality coffees
or coffees produced at below the cost
of production and still happens out there.
Just because I really prefer
lighter roasts doesn't mean
that I should say that
those are better somehow
or those are correct or right.
But now I want to hear from you
down in the comments below.
Did you try this technique?
Did you grind a little
courser, dose a little higher?
Play around with your brew temperature?
Did you like the resulting cup?
Do you usually drink your coffee
with dairy with cream, with sugar?
Did you try it without, how was it?
Let me know what I missed.
Let me know what techniques you found
for making a better tasting
dark roasted filter coffee.
I'd love to hear from all of
you down in the comments below
but for now, I'll say thank you so much
for watching and hope
you have a great day.
