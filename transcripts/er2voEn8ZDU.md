## Understanding Espresso - Grind Size (Episode #4)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er2voEn8ZDU>

Welcome to the understanding
espresso series.
A series where we take apart
an individual variable in
the espresso making process.
In the past, we've looked at
dose in, ratio and brew time.
Today, we're looking at the
most complex of the variables
in my opinion, which is the grind setting.
How fine or how coarse you
should be grinding the coffee,
and when you should use your grind setting
to make an adjustment to taste.
Espresso is a lot of fun,
but it's also immensely frustrating
especially when you're starting out.
And I would say this variable is by far
the most frustrating of
all of them to work with.
And I'll give you the reasons why
and there's kind of three reasons.
So let's say you make
a grind setting change,
going a little bit finer.
And doing so, you'll expose
a lot more surface area
of the ground coffee.
If you think about cutting
an apple into big pieces
there's not that much surface area
but if you diced it down into tiny pieces
you'd expose a lot more
of the inside of an apple.
And the same is true with a coffee bean.
And so far that's good
news, more surface area
is very useful for extracting
more coffee flavor.
But when you change the surface area
you also change the way that the grounds
interconnect with each other.
And when you tamp them down
in your little pack of coffee
the finer the pieces are,
the better they fit together,
and the harder it is for the
water to flow through them.
This will increase the contact time
between the water and the coffee.
So you have this one
change to surface area
that impacts flow rate
and contact time as well,
and that's a bit of a headache.
And then for an extra twist,
quite often, changing the grind setting
is a little bit wasteful.
Now this isn't true of every
single grinder ever made
but it's very true of many,
many. many coffee grinders
people use for espresso.
They don't perfectly push
out all of the coffee
that they grind every
time that you use them.
Inside the grinding chamber
that houses the burrs
as well as the exit chute
you'll often find some
residual ground coffee
and that was ground at a setting
maybe before you made a change.
So when you make a change,
you need to purge out some coffee
to push out to these old grounds
that are sort of set at
the wrong grind setting
with some new ones.
And that's frustrating
because some grinders
need a lot of purging and others don't
but either way that's coffee
that you never get to drink.
That's coffee that you waste.
And so changing the grind
setting is frustrating
but it's necessary.
Without grinding finely enough,
you can't do the extraction
work that you need to,
to get all the good flavor out
using only a little bit of water.
And that's the kind of nature of espresso
because you want to use
just a little bit of water
to have a strong, concentrated,
thick delicious, gooey,
sweet espresso at the end of it.
Now just quickly, I wanna go back
just through how we got to this point,
a little bit of history.
People worked out pretty
early on that to brew faster,
you had to grind finer that way,
this increased surface area meant that
those flavors were more accessible.
But quickly you got to the
point where there was a problem,
finely ground coffee is
difficult to get water through.
And in the early years of espresso
different methods were found
to increase the pressure
that the water was pushed
through with the coffee.
Eventually with compressed springs,
we got to the kind of
pressures that we use today
around nine bars of pressure.
It's the equivalent in
strange money of 130 PSI
but ultimately it's nine
atmospheres of pressure.
And that is a lot of pressure.
That causes problems in espresso brewing.
Generally speaking, you
wanna go as fine as you can,
expose as much surface area as you can
before you break the puck.
Espresso brewing happens at
these very fine pressures
and they are dependent
on resistance coming from the coffee cake.
But at some point that
very high pressured water
may well find a channel
through which to run
an easier pathway.
And what happens when an
espresso puck essentially breaks
is that it begins to channel
and more water begins to flow
through less of the coffee.
Channeling happens in most
expressos at some point
and to varying degrees.
But as you go finer and finer and finer
you increase the likelihood
of these channel forming
because you've created
such a lot of resistance
to the water pressure.
Now, the grind is not the
only variable that dictates
how good a job your puck does
of creating even resistance
throughout the whole brew.
Obviously the depth of
the puck will play a role
as does your puck preparation
how evenly the coffee is distributed
before you tamp it down.
Often people will talk
about over extraction
when you grind a little bit too finer.
I know I've done that too,
and we associate that word
with very bitter flavors
coming through in your espresso.
Generally speaking, the puck as a whole
may not actually be over extracted.
The puck as a whole maybe
under extracted actually,
but, the areas around the channels
where water has flowed much
faster and in higher volumes,
they are extremely over extracted.
So they've given up
more flavor than we want
and they've added that bitter
harshness to the shots.
But you'd argue that's
really more uneven extraction
than it is over extraction,
or just localized over extraction
rather than total over extraction.
Because again, if you're
measuring this stuff
with refractometers and
looking at your total yields
you won't see a big increase in extraction
in that incredibly fine grinds,
you'll actually see a drop.
And in the past, this actually
pushed people to experiment
with a much coarser grind
than it's typically used for espresso.
In a paper that was published
and I made a video about that,
so you should check that video out up here
when you're done watching this one.
Now I'm not gonna say, you
have to use very coarse grinds
because you end up needing
to use a higher ratio
to get a more balanced shot,
but you do get a more even extraction
using these slightly coarser grounds
than you do using very
finely ground coffee
but your end result does feel and taste
and have that kind of different
texture and strength to it.
So let's talk about using grind
in a much more practical way.
I would definitely use
grind to first and foremost
get my flow rate about right.
Let's say I'm looking for
an 18 grams in 36 grams out
in around 30 seconds.
Well, I'm gonna use my grind setting
to get me to that point.
But once I'm there, I'm gonna taste it,
and chances are, the
tweaks I'm going to make,
If the espresso is good, but not perfect
are gonna be two other
variables that we'll discuss.
If I'm still a long way
away from good tasting
I'd say I'm still very sour,
I'm gonna go finer again,
and see how that does
even if it's outside of my original spec.
But if I get my grind
setting approximately correct
then I'm gonna make those little tweaks
with dose, with yield,
potentially with temperature
in some cases, but unlikely.
But primarily I would suspect with
my coffee in and my coffee out.
They're gonna let me fine tune
that recipe pretty easily.
Now, the reason I like
to use grind like this
for the big changes,
but maybe not as often when I'm tweaking
is actually largely practical.
If you're a beginner or intermediate
in the world of espresso,
then I think making less grind changes
is probably an easier thing.
There's waste from purging,
there's the, just the
general frustration around
making those changes and
making them accurately
especially if you have a new grinder
or you're just new to the process.
So I think a big changes
with grind are good,
and also if you have a stepped to grinder
where the steps between each
setting are quite large,
then again I would go probably
for the finer of the two
even if that means dropping down my dose
and that kind of stuff,
because I'm just more likely
to have a good experience
that way than being stuck
with a slightly coarser
grind that I might want.
If I lived in a world
with unlimited coffee,
unlimited time and resources,
then I would use grind to
really, really, really,
make small adjustments,
but that needs a very good grinder,
a lot of patience and
quite a lot of waste.
And I'm not sure that's great real world
sort of advice or recommendations.
So I would say you're more
likely to enjoy your espressos
and the espresso making process,
If you're not throwing away
a ton of coffee each time.
So at the risk of repeating myself
use your grind to get close,
get good tasting espresso.
If things are dominantly sour
you need to grind a little bit finer.
If you're finding things
are getting a little bit
too bitter and harsh, or you're
getting a lot of channeling
then maybe come back a little bit coarser.
I'll summarize all this in a second,
I'll give you some basic
rules for using grind,
but first I wanna talk about
the sponsor of this video,
which is Skillshare.
Skillshare is an online learning community
full of thousands of classes
for creative and curious
people like you and me.
And if you watch these videos,
then you'll know that over the years,
Skillshare has been very useful for me
to develop my filmmaking skills,
but there's a lot more than
just filmmaking classes there.
Recently I've been enjoying
a productivity master class
from Alli Abdel.
Now I'm very curious to listen to someone
who manages to be both
a full-time You Tuber
and a doctor at the same time
because it lines up with my values
which is why you can't
just work more hours,
you've got to work smarter.
And his approach is really interesting,
It's a great course full of
tons of useful information.
And there's so much more inside Skillshare
to feed your curiosity
and for less than $10 a month
with an annual subscription,
you get unlimited access to every class,
and I think that is fantastic value.

So to wrap up, I'll give you
a few simple rules to use
when thinking about grind setting.
So rule one, once again,
use it to get in the ballpark of tasty.
Fix your recipe, don't vary that
just use your grind setting
to get to pretty good,
and then tweak from there
using your other variables in the recipe.
Rule two, generally speaking,
push it as fine as you can,
before you start to see
channeling happening.
Now, channeling would be very obvious
if you using a naked portafilter
and you'll start to see an
even flow in your basket
especially in the last
third of the espresso.
But you can also see it
in a spouted portafilter.
You'll just be looking for
a sudden increase in flow
as coffee starts to gush out of the spouts
in the last third of the of the shot
or potentially the last half
If things have gone really wrong.
Channeled expressos tend to taste
a little bit weaker than
you expect, kind of hollow.
They have this acidity
coupled with this bitterness
that you get in the finish
this kind of harsh biting after taste.
In the past I've even recommended grinding
from some grinders into a
little collection chamber
or bucket or tin or something,
shaking out any potential clumps
and then dosing into your
portafilter from there
for this kind of a reason.
Puck prep is really important,
but going too fine will produce channeling
kind of no matter what.
Rule three, only change one
flow related variable at a time.
If you're changing your grind,
do not change the dose
of coffee in your puck
at the same time.
You won't understand or get insight
into the impact of either one that way
and you won't know what's gone
right, or what's gone wrong.
So if you're changing your grind
keep everything else the same,
so you can understand
the nature of the change that you've made.
And rule four, purging is essential.
And it's better to purge and
waste five grams of coffee
than it is to waste the
whole dose that you ground
incorrectly, pull the shot off and wasted.
So if you are changing your grind setting,
with most grinders, five grams, 10 grams,
it really depends on
the make and the model
but just make sure you're getting nothing
but the new grind setting
that you wanna test
to see if it makes the espresso
that you want to drink.
But now I'd like to hear from you.
How do you feel about setting the grind?
Does it freak you out?
Does it stress you out to
change your grind setting?
Does it feel like you make
a change and nothing happens
and then something happens later on
or you just feel like you chase it
round and around and around and around
and you never get where you wanna go.
And I'd love to hear from you
down in the comments below,
let me know which bit
of this spoke to you,
let me know what you want me to go into
in further depth in the future.
But for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching,
and I hope you have a great day.
