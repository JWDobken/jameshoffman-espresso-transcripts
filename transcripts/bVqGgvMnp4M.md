## XeoLeo Vs Fellow Ode Vs Wilfa Uniform: A Grinder Comparison

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVqGgvMnp4M>

Today, we're gonna be
doing a grinder comparison.
As a comparison, it's a
grouping, it's kind of weird,
but I promise you, there's
method to my madness.
Now, two of these grinders
we have seen before.
The Wilfa Uniform's appeared
in a couple of videos already.
This is the grinder that I have at home.
If you haven't seen anything about it,
click up here or down in
the description below.
And then we have the Fellow Ode
that was in a video recently.
If you wanna have a little look at that,
that's up here or down the description.
And then there's this thing.
This is the Xeoleo, I'm not
sure of the pronunciation.
It's a grinder I bought on
AliExpress for about $160.
And it's a fun little
grinder that sort of,
sort of makes sense in this
comparison because the Wilfa,
this one is about 325 pounds
or 275 without the scale in the top.
The Ode seems to be around 295 pounds.
So this is half the
price of the other two.
Why is it here?
Well, it's here because of its burr set.
This has a standard flat burr set.
This one has a kind of
hybrid interlocking burr set.
And the most extreme version of that
is actually inside this,
which is called ghost teeth
burrs, or interlocking burrs,
and they look like nothing else, really.
They're a really unique design
that you really don't see very much.
But I wanted to pick up a
grinder like this that had them
and see how it fared.
Here's how the testing is gonna run.
I'll just quickly show
you a few little things
about this Xeoleo,
just so you're kind of
up to speed with it,
if you're familiar with
these other two grinders.
And then we're gonna
run a few simple tests.
We're ultimately gonna brew three V60s
side-by-side that we'll
taste, but before that,
we'll start with a
pretty simple speed test.
We'll grind 30 grams of coffee
in each one of these grinders
and see how long it takes.
Then we'll have a little look
at the grinds distribution,
nothing too complicated, but I
hope interesting nonetheless.
And then, ultimately, we
will brew those three,
and taste them side-by-side.
Now, when it comes to setting
the grind for the V60,
this was an interesting challenge.
Both of the two grinders
that have interlocking burrs
have limits on how fine they
can go before the burrs touch.
And that limit is much coarser
than a standard flat burr grinder.
So this grinder can go all the
way down past espresso fine
into kind of Turkish coffee
fine, almost like a flour.
These two both have a very similar limit
that's just about fine enough
for me to brew a V60 with.
Without that limit,
we could have brewed a
different brew method
or a different amount of coffee,
but this seems the fairest way.
I was able to dial them all in
to a very similar extraction
level which should make,
I hope, for an interesting tasting.
This won't be, however,
an exhaustive tasting because there's
only so much coffee
tasting that can be done,
but it should be interesting nonetheless.
The one other thing to
note is that this grinder
has been in use for a couple of years now.
It grinds 30 to 60 grams
of coffee most days
for the last two years.
These have all had a good amount
of coffee put through them.
They've also both been
recalibrated to be able to go
as fine as is possible
without the burrs touching,
but this is just a much more
seasoned and used grinder.
Let's start, though,
with a quick overview
of this little grinder.
For $160, it's kind of fun.
Its burr set is here at the front
and it is vertically mounted,
which I think is generally a good thing
with the motor sitting behind it.
Your hopper on top feels pretty plastic.
Doesn't feel very expensive
or particularly lovely,
but it's $160, but it does
sit on top of a little gate.
This would allow you to turn on your motor
without coffee falling into the burrs,
but having loaded your
beans into the hopper,
once your motors up and running,
you can just open the little gate
and your beans will drop
into a running motor,
which is generally considered
better for the grinder.
So that's a nice little touch.
On the back of the grinder,
the power switch has two power settings.
It has a continuous mode.
And it has a push-to-go mode,
because on the front here,
there's a little button,
and as you push it in,
the grinder runs.
Now, it comes with this dosing cup
that seems a little
bit odd at first glance
because it's got three pieces.
Piece number one is your grinds catch bin,
pretty standard, nice enough.
There's a little insert for it though,
which looks like a tea
strainer, but instead,
has a bunch of holes in it
for potentially sieving out the fines,
which is an unusual addition
to a grinder, I will add.
The holes appear to be
about 500 microns in size,
which is quite large,
but probably pretty effective at getting
anything remotely fine out of there.
And then if you are shaking,
there is a little lid.
So you can grind in, put the lid on top,
and shake the life out of it to get rid
of any fines that you
potentially don't want
in your grind distribution.
I will just say now,
having criticized
certainly the Ode for this,
and a little bit, the Wilfa,
this is a messy grinder.
Coffee goes everywhere.
Whether you do a little spritzing first,
a little droplet of water
in the beans or not,
it makes a terrible mess.
And it does annoy me
quite a bit, but for $160,
can it grind coffee in an
interesting and delicious way?
That's really the question.
And to talk about those burr sets,
I suppose we should open it up.
To open it up is actually pretty easy.
There's two screws on the front here
and we'll take 'em off
kind of the same time.
Now, the teeth on this
are really unlike anything
I really ever see in any
other coffee grinder.
I've never seen burrs like this
in a commercial grinder that I've used.
I'm not saying they don't exist,
just that I'm unfamiliar with them.
But you've got these two
sets of teeth that interlock
with each other that
are gonna cut the coffee
in a totally different way.
That's really interesting.
That was my motivation, actually,
to buy this grinder, it wasn't the price.
I just wanted a ghost teeth
burr grinder to check out,
to see what I thought of it.
Does it reduce fines?
Does it grind more uniformly?
Does coffee taste better?
These are the questions we wanna answer.
So I'll put it back together,
weigh out some coffee,
and we'll run our first
test, which is grind speed.
Ready, steady, go.
Pretty quick, let's try the Ode.
Very quick.
And now let's try the Wilfa.
A bit slower, a lot slower.
Now, for some people, this
is an absolute deal breaker.
They can't stand how slow this is.
I've talked about in the past
that it doesn't bother me that much
because I'm usually doing other things
while coffee is grinding.
I can be sorting out water,
rinsing papers on a brewer.
There's other stuff to be doing.
But in comparison to these two,
it is so, so slow.
So for today's video,
I'm gonna be using a
couple of tools from Kruve.
This is the sifter that
you've seen before.
I'm gonna be sifting this
with two screens inside it.
This will allow me to separate
the coffee pieces by size.
The first piece is 1,000
microns, a millimeter in size.
Anything bigger than this for me
is a little bit bigger than I might want.
It's heading towards being a bit bolder-y.
Then you've got a screen at 400 microns.
Anything below this will be
a fine-ish piece of coffee,
not necessarily a quote/unquote, "fine,"
but certainly a finer piece.
These are very broad, broad,
sort of cross-sections
of coffee distribution.
But I'm actually less worried
these days about fines,
and I'm much more worried about
larger pieces in my coffee.
It's a big chunk of coffee
that I just won't get anything out of.
It's inevitably going to under-extract
in comparison to the
rest of the coffee there.
So bigger pieces are, for me,
as big a concern as very fine pieces.
And, you know, while there are things
out there to sieve out fine pieces,
rarely do people sieve out large pieces
or worry about them very much,
which I think is perhaps a mistake.
Now, I also recently bought this.
This is the Brewler from Kruve,
which I think is a
reasonably hilarious pun.
It's kind of useful in today's video.
One, I told you that the size of the holes
in that sieving piece for
the Xeoleo were 500 microns.
This just let me check that.
So you've got holes of each
micron size along here.
Now, this is intended, I think,
to be put next to coffee
to give you an idea
of how large your pieces of coffee are.
They also give you a little
grind distribution chart
to show you roughly where
each brew method kind of lies.
Let's start sifting.
I'll give each grinder a
couple of minutes of shaking,
and then, we'll have a
look at how those 30 grams
of coffee have separated out.
So far, so interesting.
And I'll throw that data up now
as a percentage of the total grounds,
that way it's kind of normalized
for any retention stuck in the grinder.
And you can have a look at that chart.
Now, this is really important.
Before you make any real
meaningful decisions
or inferences from this data,
know that it's mostly worthless.
This is not a full grind distribution.
This just gives you a rough idea
of how many pieces are
above a certain size,
how many pieces are below
a certain size, that's it.
There's no more granular
information about the distribution.
What's notable to me is
that these are all grinders
achieving a similar level of extraction
for a similar brew method
with quite different grind distributions.
When you brew coffee,
it's really only the
surface of the grounds
that can be extracted.
In a large piece of coffee,
water won't really meaningfully
penetrate inside it
to get the good stuff out.
It'll really be what's on the surface.
What you can't tell, even from
a ground distribution chart,
is total surface area because it's
kind of a 2D snapshot of a 3D thing.
Looking at this, I don't know
how they're gonna achieve
a similar level of surface area,
and I don't know how
that's going to taste yet.
That's what we're gonna find out.
But what we can say is that Uniform
is better from that testing,
even though it may have
less larger pieces,
comparatively few very fine pieces,
we don't know whether the
stuff between 400 and 1,000
is a wide spread or unimodal.
We just don't know that stuff.
But when we taste, that's
the important thing,
and we should probably taste.
But before we do that, I
should note that there is
one grinder probably
missing from this range.
And that's one from Baratza,
something like the Sette.
I'm not including Baratza
in testing at the moment
because I'm doing a coffee giveaway
with any sponsored video.
I'm giving away five Baratza Encores
to anyone who really needs them,
anywhere in the 39 countries that we can
ship to and warranty to.
If you can afford a grinder,
please don't enter and buy
one from a local business.
But if life is tough right now,
and you could really do with a grinder,
click down below, it's free to enter.
From my point of view,
it just felt a little
bit wrong to be working
with one company while
comparing it to another.
Even though I'm paying for these grinders,
I don't want the perception of bias
in these kind of reviews.
And this is all possible, these giveaways,
thanks to this video sponsor,
which is Squarespace.

So we're gonna brew
three V60s back-to-back.
What I'm gonna do is
pour a good size sample
of each brew into a cupping bowl.
It'll be marked on the bottom
for which grinder it came from.
Once they're all brewed,
then I will leave,
someone else will switch them around
so I don't know what I'm tasting.
I'll let them all settle
to kind of room temperature
when they'll be very easy
to taste the differences.
And I come back and taste
them and talk about them.
And then at the end of that,
I'll find out which is which, let's brew.
So the brew's been brewed.
I'm gonna leave the room.
These are gonna get switched around,
and I'll come back when
they're cool enough
that they're all pretty
similar temperatures,
and I'll start tasting them.
Now, as we get into the tasting,
this is a really important
thing to think about first.
This is why people get kind
of mad about refractometers
because if you measure
the refractive index,
if you measure the strength
of these three brews,
they're all pretty much the same,
but they're gonna taste different.
Which means that just
hitting the right numbers
doesn't guarantee you a good brew.
It's how you get there,
that's kind of everything.
Secondly, I am familiar
with these grinders.
This isn't the first
time I brewed with them.
I've brewed with the Xeoleo a little bit,
I've had it a few months now.
Obviously, I've brewed with the Wilfa
for a couple of years at least.
The Ode, only maybe a month or so.
But it's not my first time brewing these.
So I do have some expectations
around how coffee has tasted
from these that might be
reflected in this blind tasting.
We'll find out.
This brew is okay,
but it just has this present
kind of bitterness coming
in at the back of it.
Like, it's a little hollow,
but also a little bitter.
This particular kind of
bitterness, I'm gonna take a guess,
reminds me of the bitterness
I often get from the Xeoleo grinder.
There's often something
about it that just feels
a little bit harsh and
almost burnt in the coffee.
And I don't really understand
why it tastes like that,
but it often does to me.
Certainly with lighter
roasts, it can shift that way.
I haven't brewed a lot of
darker roasts with this,
which may be where it shines.
Anyway, moving on.
That brew is very clean.
It's very sweet.
It's very pleasant.
At this point, I don't
know which grinder it is.
It's just a, it's just a really
nice, sweet brew of coffee.
And honestly, so is this one.
These are both very nice.
What I would say with both of them,
if I didn't know the grinder,
I would wanna go just a fraction finer.
Which means if one of these is the Ode,
and I think one of them is the Ode,
it's frustrating to me that I can't go
that little bit finer still.
That is for me, with light to
medium filter style roasts,
a little bit of a headache.
If I had to pick,
maybe this one is just a
fractionally more complex brew?
This is also very nice too.
Like, these are both very tasty brews.
This one is a tier
below in terms of flavor
even though it's of a
very similar extraction.
It just doesn't feel as kind of coherent,
for want of a less pretentious term.
But it just doesn't feel as together.
It just feels a bit disjointed.
There's some astringency here.
There's some bitterness here.
I just don't like it as much.
This, in this particular
one-off experiment,
I like the most, but this is
also a very tasty brew too.
I would struggle potentially
in a triangle test
to pick them apart.
Let's find out what's what.
This has an X at the bottom,
which means it is indeed the Xeoleo.
This has a little U at
the bottom for Uniform.
And this one, therefore, is of course,
I don't know why I'm looking,
it's obviously the Ode.
Let's wrap this all up
with a little summary.
Let's start with the Xeoleo.
This is cheap and it's
surprisingly full-featured
for its cheapness.
It's easy to access the burrs.
It's east to take it apart.
There's a few little details
that are kind of nice.
It's messy, it's really messy.
And honestly, I don't love
the coffee that it produces.
It's up against grinders twice its price.
So it would be kind of
shocking if it made coffee
as good as those grinders,
and it doesn't make coffee as good.
If I was drinking darker roasts,
I wonder if the burrs inside
this are better suited
to those kinds of roasts, or you know,
that in combination
with the sifting option
that it has built into it,
which I'm generally against,
because it's pretty wasteful.
So it's kind of fun.
It doesn't feel too cheap.
It doesn't feel super well-made either.
It's kind of worth the money?
I'm not sure I'd recommend though,
importing them if you have no support.
If it breaks, all that kind of stuff,
you're kind of on your own.
So buying stuff like this is
very much at your own risk.
The Ode is a great little grinder that has
a couple of frustrations for me.
I wish it could go finer.
And if I had an Ode, I wouldn't
be selling it right now,
I wouldn't be upgrading it
to a Uniform, necessarily,
because I'd be waiting for them
to produce some other burr options.
There's both the SSP burrs
that I'll test in the future
alongside the promised new
burrs from Fellow themselves,
that are able to go
that a little bit finer.
This makes it a kind
of interesting platform
for different burrs in the future.
And for that, it is interesting.
Overall, it's a capable grinder.
It's a good-looking grinder.
And I think it has an exciting future.
Right now, though, if I was shopping,
I would just be thinking about,
is it worth paying the
extra for the new burrs
or would I just wait
until they offer new burrs
at the same price as this right now?
And that leaves the Uniform,
which does a good job.
It makes nice coffee.
And it has a very wide
range of grind sizes.
It's incredibly slow.
It comes with a scale if you want it to,
that's really not worth the money,
but the cheaper one, I think,
is worth the money at 275 pounds.
It's not perfect, I've talked
about that in the reviews.
It has its limitations, but
in this particular situation,
I think it did very well.
If you started from scratch
and you don't own a grinder
or you're looking to
upgrade to this level,
it should be a contender
and is worth thinking about,
but I would be holding off to see
how the new burrs perform with this thing.
And that's definitely something
I will look at in the future.
This particular one is
going to a Patreon backer
that's been picked
already and is heading out
as soon as we finish this review.
I'll buy another unit in the future
to put different burr sets in that,
to give it a full test.
But let me know down
in the comments below,
what did I miss today?
What did you want me to
explore about these grinders
and tell you a little bit more about?
All of them, it's very easy
to access the burrs on them.
All of them, it's easy
to change the burrs.
Maintenance is pretty limited.
There's plenty of control and
adjustment across all of them.
But what more do you wanna see?
I'd love to hear from you
down in the comments below,
but for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching.
Hope you have a great day.
