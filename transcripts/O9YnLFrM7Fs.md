## A Beginner's Guide To Buying Great Coffee

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YnLFrM7Fs&t=804s>

welcome to today's video and the
beginning of a series of sorts a
beginner's guide to coffee and this
video is a beginner's guide to coffee
buying
now i know you know how to buy coffee
but what today's video is all about is
helping you
explore the world of coffee more easily
more enjoyably
with less mistakes here's the thing if
you have found a coffee that you love be
it a coffee roaster or a coffee brand
that's great i don't want to stop you
drinking that thing i'm not going to
tell you what to drink today
but part of the joy of coffee is the
diversity of flavor and whatever you're
enjoying now
there's something something out there
that i think you could enjoy
even more but what i don't want you to
do is experiment
gamble buy something that kind of looks
good and then hate it
that's the goal today help you buy stuff
that you're likely to really enjoy
and avoid stuff that you're likely to
really dislike we're gonna break this
down into three
sections part one is gonna be the kind
of golden rules of buying coffee
part two will be where to buy coffee and
the pros and cons of each
and then part three will be about kind
of decoding a bag of coffee decoding the
label on a bag of coffee
what are they trying to tell you and how
do you match that marry that up to what
you want
before we begin i should disclose a
couple of very important ways in which i
am biased firstly i have a strong
preference and i'm a big advocate for
specialty coffee if you're watching this
and you don't like specialty coffee
that's okay this is still a useful video
for you but just know that i have a very
strong preference towards it secondly
i also co-own a coffee company now none
of our products are in the video today
there are no links to our products in
the description down below
but you should know and i should
disclose this right at the start so
let's begin
the golden rules for buying coffee and
the first one
you probably know buy fresh
but what does fresh mean now coffee
after roasting declines
in a pretty steady way over time it
loses its aromatics they kind of float
off into the atmosphere and escape and
you also develop some
unpleasant flavors things go stale and
they begin to oxidize
and so a combination of those things is
is what happens when coffee stales and
goes off
it's food safe for a really really long
time
some of you might have seen i've drunk
coffee from the 1950s and while i
wouldn't necessarily recommend it
yeah coffee lasts a really really long
time but it's not
at its best now typically coffee will be
dated
in one of two different ways specialty
coffee typically will offer you a roast
date the day on which it was roasted and
that's pretty useful you know how old
the coffee is exactly however
if you're selling a product through a
supermarket supermarkets don't
want you to put a roast date on there
they hate roast dates they want
a best before date this is often 12 even
18
sometimes 24 months after the roasting
date
so you don't really know when the coffee
was roasted this is not a choice that
the roasters get to make really this is
a choice from supermarkets in fact
here on the table i've got the same
coffee one
from a supermarket and this has a best
before date
and the same roaster same coffee bought
directly from them
has a roasted on date so understand
this is a little bit confusing way you
buy it will impact the information that
you have
more on that a little bit later on today
we're going to cover coffees for both
filter coffee drinking and for espresso
and what gets confusing about the
messaging of fresh is that fresh
isn't always the best now when you roast
coffee a lot of co2 comes out that's why
any bag of coffee will have a little
valve on it that you can squeeze the gas
out of now when it comes to espresso in
particular
fresher isn't always better because
there's a lot of co2 in very fresh
coffee beans when you try and brew them
as espresso a lot of gas comes out in
this pressurized environment and it can
make
for a disrupted brewing process it's
harder to brew
really really fresh coffee and many
people rest the coffee
for seven to ten days sometimes two
weeks if not sometimes longer
to make it a little easier to brew for
espresso with filtered coffee
it's less of a concern a day or two fine
you know it's pretty easy to brew from
that point onwards it gets a little bit
easier the older it is
when you're trying to hit a kind of
window of anywhere from a week to
six weeks in which it's going to be at
its best and speaking of at its best
we need to talk also about ground coffee
versus whole bean i will
always always always advocate for whole
bean coffee for a couple of reasons
firstly it's better value for money with
ground coffee
they'll often pack it in a protective
atmosphere but once you open that bag
and air gets in
the clock sticking and you might have
one or two days to enjoy it
at its best yes it's still drinkable
yeah it's probably okay for a little
while more
but you're not getting what you paid for
whole beans
last much longer and when you grind them
they begin to degrade but if you grind
before you use them
you're just gonna have a better time
it's better value for money to buy whole
beans
and secondly grinding coffee is one of
the great pleasures of life
you know i don't want people to miss out
on having their morning be that little
bit more
aromatic and enjoyable as final guidance
for hobby and coffee
anything that's a kind of light medium
roast i think is generally fine
four to six to eight weeks after
roasting depending on how you're storing
it
if it's pre-ground it's not gonna be
that case and if it's a darker roast
i would say maybe four to six weeks
maximum because darker roads go stale a
little bit quicker the second rule i'm
going to give you
is to buy traceable coffee buy coffee
from
as distinct a place as you can that
might be a single farm
that might be a cooperative of growers
that might be a region in some cases
but historically coffee was just sold by
country of origin
and you'd be skeptical if the wine you
bought on the shelf just said
france that's not enough right you would
want more which region is this from at
the very least
same with coffee just because the coffee
is from guatemala or colombia
well it doesn't really tell you that
much about how it's going to taste
there's huge variation within just about
every single producing origin
of flavor of styles so knowing what
country it's from
isn't that useful to you it's a little
useful but it's not that useful
if you can't tell where in a country a
coffee is from
it's not particularly traceable now the
secret sort of shortcut of traceable
coffees
is that adding traceability to a coffee
keeping it separate all the way from a
farm or a co-op
to you the consumer costs money it adds
cost to that product and that will only
be done in situations where that coffee
is good enough
in terms of its taste and its quality to
merit a premium price
there's no point keeping a coffee that
doesn't taste very good traceable all
the way through
because it doesn't have the value
necessary to kind of return on that
investment so that's why traceability i
think
is a nice little shortcut to quality i
don't want to tell you how much to spend
on coffee
but i would say that spending more buys
you generally better quality better
tasting coffee
and more of that money is likely to go
back to the producer so i'd obviously
encourage you
to invest a little bit in the coffee
that you drink this last tip
it's not really optional but it's kind
of complicated tip and that's to buy
seasonally here's the deal different
countries around the world harvest
coffee at different
times this means that the raw coffees
are arriving into kind of consuming
countries at different times of year
raw coffee lasts longer generally than
roasted coffee
and a roaster may carry a coffee from
anywhere from a few weeks to
six to eight months classically roasters
would carry a coffee
all year round right they would have a
guatemalan offering
12 months of the year even though for
three four
sometimes five months that coffee wasn't
very good because the raw coffee was a
little bit old
specialty has embraced seasonality which
means that you may only see coffees from
certain origins
for six months of the year i'm not going
to ask you to pay attention to which
country is harvesting when or understand
shipping dates or that kind of stuff
but do look to buy from places where the
offering changes reasonably regularly
if they're doing that if they have
different products on the shelf quite
often
while that can be initially frustrating
it's actually a good thing
it means the raw coffees are nice and
fresh and you're gonna get the best
possible experience now let's talk about
where to buy
coffee for this i'm gonna say there are
three kind of places to buy coffee
one is the supermarket two would be
a cafe or coffee shop or a shop on the
high street let's say or in your
neighborhood
and the third place would be online we
need to talk about each of these
because they impact the offering and
your options and the way you should
approach buying in those places so let's
start with the supermarket
right it has a couple of big advantages
firstly for most people it's incredibly
convenient they're often visiting or
buying for supermarket online or
you know it's a part of your week it's
part of your kind of routine day to day
and secondly things there are generally
cheaper supermarkets
compete with each other they're happy to
use their size and their scale to
diminish their profits
and so typically products in the
supermarket are as cheap as they're
likely to be
anywhere that's the good news here's the
bad news supermarkets do not treat
coffee like fresh food
as i said before they don't want you to
think about when that coffee was roasted
because you might pick up a bag and
think oh this is two months old but if
they give you a best before date
well you might think oh i've got 10
months left to use this product now the
way supermarkets work is that they may
buy from a single supplier
that goes into a centralized
distribution center then eventually goes
to the individual supermarket
goes onto the shelf works its way slowly
forwards to the front of the shelf
and it can take months from it being
produced to it being sold
so freshness is really really really
difficult you can buy
good quality traceable coffees there
well roasted coffees that i would
say are good coffee is definitely worth
drinking but know that
the trade-off is freshness so now let's
talk about coffee shops
and right now as coffee shops around the
world begin to reopen in many places
this is a great way to support them i
just want to put that out there now
now coffee shops have some advantages
one you you often go to them so there's
a convenience factor there
two there's the opportunity for a
conversation you can talk to someone and
say i like this kind of coffee this is a
brand i like or this is an experience i
had that i liked
what can you recommend and a good coffee
shop should be able to help you now in
terms of freshness their product
typically will be
actually pretty fresh it may not be as
fresh as buying online we'll come to
that in a second
but if you need coffee to use right now
coffee shops are perfect chances are
that coffee is
five six seven days old and they
certainly will have something that old
that you can buy
it's beautifully fresh perfectly ready
to brew
and you can take it home and have a
delicious cup of coffee one more thing
don't forget that coffee shops are often
serving the coffee they retail
you know there may be an opportunity to
try before you buy taste something
or buy something drink it really enjoy
it go back and take a bag of that home
to enjoy in the morning
big fan of buying from coffee shops
let's talk about
online now online gives you probably the
most variety it's often competitive in
price you're buying directly from a
roaster
and that means in many cases though not
all but in many cases they will roast
your coffee once they receive your order
they'll ship it often
the same day and it will come to you a
day or two after
after being roasted incredibly fresh but
like we said
fresher isn't always better if you're
kind of managing the freshness and
you know you've got like a week left on
this bag great time to buy online
you know like that's that's a good
decision it'll come it'll be nicely
rested you can go into that bag next
life is easy but it requires a touch
more organization
now often roasters will offer things
like subscription services i think those
are generally a
great way to go it sort of takes away
having to remember to do something
coffee just arrives through your door
that
i think is a great thing to do and often
for many people they'll go through more
than one bag a month and so a great way
to set up life is to have one bag come
on a subscription from a roaster
and then buy one bag on top of it from a
different place or from a cafe or from
wherever because the whole point that i
keep coming back to is that coffee is
really really fun
and tasting different stuff is really
really fun so
those are my recommendations and those
are the impacts of buying on each of
those different places now before we
move into the third section where we
decode a bag of coffee
there's a short ad from this video
sponsor which is skillshare
skillshare is an online learning
community full of thousands of classes
for creative and curious people like you
and me
it's a great place to explore new skills
or deepen existing passions now recently
i've been enjoying two classes from zach
mulligan
i've been wanting to refresh my
cinematography skills and both of his
classes have been
fantastic now with an annual

value so go click the link in the
description and enjoy a year of learning
and creativity thank you to skillshare
for sponsoring this video so let's talk
about all of these bags of coffee here
and work out what they're trying to tell
us about how they taste
now to kind of get a wide coverage of
coffee for the video today
it required a trip to the supermarket
which was always good for me to go back
and
look at that enormous wall of choice and
try and work out what i wanted to buy
and that's kind of what we're thinking
about here right you walk up to that big
wall of coffee
you pick up a bag and you're like will i
like this
so the first thing we're going to talk
about is going to be roast degree
how darkly a coffee is roasted generally
we talk about either light or medium or
dark
and in the case of supermarket coffees
often they don't use that language
often they use strength they'll say
strength five
strength three now they don't generally
put anything down a strength one or two
because no one wants
weak coffee so the functional range is
generally three through five which is
kind of absurd
but it is what it is now specialty
coffee gets very angry about the use of
the word strength on the front of a bag
because strength means something else
strength is how much coffee to how much
water you know i mean the more coffee
you use to brew a cup the stronger
that's going to be that's the correct
usage of strength but
in the defense of the supermarket
coffees at least they're trying to
properly communicate
roasted degree to some extent for people
specialty coffee often
does not describe roast degree now it
does occasionally there's a bag here
that has along the bottom here medium
roast right that's that's that's
nice but that's not common in specialty
coffee
the most common thing to see is a
description about whether it might be
used as a filter coffee or as an
espresso coffee
now when it comes to the term roasted
for espresso
that tells you a little bit regarding
the coffee from that particular roaster
right most roasters will roast their
espresso sort of focused products
a little bit darker a little bit deeper
than they would do their filter coffee
roasted products
however some people in specialty use
what's called an omni
roast where they're kind of roasting for
both at the same time
it's a kind of philosophy thing for many
roasters their approach to espresso to
filter coffee to roasting as a whole
but if you are buying specialty coffee
and it does not have
any indication of roast on it it is a
light to medium roast
that's the default on the occasions that
they don't roast that way they tend to
signify that if there's a description of
roast
beer by country description which
doesn't really mean anything like french
roast
or just dark roast then you know it's
different but otherwise
you can presume it to be light to medium
roasted with the supermarket stuff
the higher the strength the darker the
roast and generally speaking the lighter
the roast of coffee the more acidity it
will have
the darker the roast the more bitterness
it will have and the less acidity it'll
have
and you know specialty feels that light
to medium gives you nice sweetness a
little bit of acidity not too much
bitterness and tons and tons of flavor
of where the coffee comes from which is
why that's such a popular roasting style
choice for specialty companies
now we need to talk about the
descriptors and generally
specialty companies and in fact more and
more commercial companies will offer you
maybe three sometimes more
descriptive words now these are doing
two different jobs
and i think people can forget about this
firstly
they are trying to describe in some way
the taste of the coffee
and secondly they're trying to entice
you the buyer
to buy that bag of coffee it's half use
and it's half sales
and it's important to remember that in
some cases descriptions could be so
odd or unusual or kind of contrary and
clashing that that really doesn't work
but
in many cases it does and things sound
completely delicious
those words promise a great deal if you
tell me my coffee is going to taste of
caramel
well i expect it to taste almost as if
you've put caramel
in the bag and it leads to further
confusion with the consumer who thinks
oh is this like a flavored coffee is
this like a caramel
flavored coffee because those exist but
often no
it's not they're trying to communicate
something about the coffee's taste
to you with that word we'll come to that
a bit more
very soon one other quick tip specialty
coffee is
a little bit like wine except for one
thing the very highest priced wines are
often
the most elegant the most kind of
classic the most beautiful wines
but they would be familiar and enjoyable
to most people
the highest priced coffees tend to be
the most unusual the least kind of
coffee tasting coffees so it's just one
to bear in mind
if you're looking at a more expensive
coffee have a look at those words are
they promising you a very unusual
experience
and is that what you want in some cases
yes it is and in other cases
no it's not one other thing to bear in
mind is that often these roasters come
up with their descriptions for coffees
through comparative tasting they're not
just tasting that one coffee on its own
they're comparing it to other coffees
that they're also roasting and serving
now we've talked a lot on this channel
about learning to taste there's some
information up here if you want to
develop your tasting skills but
comparative tasting is really useful
for kind of breaking apart the flavors
of coffee but if you the consumer don't
have that comparative tasting experience
when you drink it
it can feel harder to pull out the berry
qualities of a coffee or the the kind of
ripe
pear promised by the roaster but if you
were comparing it to something else
oh the differences would be more obvious
and yeah this is kind of more
pear-like in its way in its flavor
compared to coffee b
or c or d so know that there is an
element of frustration that's almost
inevitable
because you won't have had the same
comparative experience as a coffee
roaster
but generally they're doing their best
to broadcast some key information to you
to help you really find out if you're
going to enjoy that coffee or not
now what i can't do is know what your
personal preferences are around what you
really really like what i
can do however is understand some things
that you really really dislike
and give you some guidance there there
are three categories of kind of coffee
experience
that really trigger dislike for people
i'll explain some people cannot stand it
when a coffee is quite light bodied
quite delicate quite tea like almost
it doesn't taste like coffee to them and
and i want to help you avoid buying
coffees like that if you feel that way
now
generally specialty coffee is often of a
certain roast degree as we said it's a
kind of light to medium roast
and the kinds of coffees that are
typically bought by specialty companies
are often as a default kind of
medium-bodied
generally they'll use language to
highlight the texture of the coffee
if it is not a kind of medium-bodied
coffee if it's quite light-bodied
look for words they'll use like delicate
or elegant or often explicitly tea like
look for descriptors of things being
quite floral you know those kind of
words suggest
lightness to you and that's what they're
trying to say and if they use
kind of creamy or rich or those kind of
words
then they're suggesting it is a
fuller-bodied coffee in that way but if
there's no texture words
i would say as a kind of vaguely useful
rule
it's a medium-bodied coffee now the
second one i think is a much easier one
to kind of decode
and it's a much bigger love hate aspect
for a lot of people with the coffee they
drink
and that is the sensation of acidity
some people
do not want any acidity in their coffee
the idea of an acidic coffee
is genuinely repulsive to them and
that's completely okay
there are other people who want all the
acidity in their coffee they want it to
be bright and juicy and vibrant
how do we help you there well it's going
to be fruit words
if you see fresh fruit words in the
descriptors
there may be berries there might be
apple right
those kind of fruit descriptors if they
are referring to fresh fruits
that coffee is going to have a
reasonable amount of acidity if you see
berry fruits i'd expect a lot of acidity
if you see citrus fruits i'd expect a
lot of acidity if you see things like
apple or pear
yeah i would expect a good amount of
acidity if the words are fruit words but
they're kind of transformed if they're
cooked fruit words if it's described as
jammy
or candied orange for example then i
would expect a little acidity
but not a lot if a description has no
fruit words
then i would expect very low acidity
from it if they're using other words
like
caramel or treacle or nuts or chocolate
those are non-fruit words and they are
suggesting low acidity in that regard
so that will help you kind of decode how
much acidity do i generally expect
the third kind of key aspect around sort
of love hate with coffee
is what i would call fermented fruit
flavors that sounds a bit odd
but there are styles of coffee they're
often dry or natural processed coffees
where the whole cherry was dried in the
sun
instead of the seeds being squeezed out
and sort of washed and kind of cleaned
of their fruit before being dried if
it's been dried inside the fruit
then a little fermentation can go on and
you can get these kind of funky very
unusual flavors
that are often described on bags of
coffee as tropical fruit
if you see pineapple if you see mango if
you see strawberry even
chances are there's going to be some
fermented fruit qualities to the coffee
in the bag
if it says dry process or natural
process on the bag
expect those flavors now some people
love those flavors
they are fascinating they are unlike any
other coffee flavors
they are easily identifiable they're
just kind of fun other people are
completely disgusted by them and they
hate them for that reason
it's really important to me that people
understand how to not buy those or to
buy those on purpose
and never make a mistake if you don't
like fermented fruit flavors and that in
my experience is
around 40 of people then i would
strongly avoid
dry or natural processed coffees unless
they're making a lot of promises around
how clean it tastes there's no weird
fruit flavors on the bag
if they're saying it's just like clean
or sweet or chocolate or nuts
maybe but if there's any kind of fruit
on there chances are
that's not going to be to your tastes
and it's just a bit of a gamble which i
want you to avoid
now i've talked a lot about the sort of
theory side the reason i bought a bunch
of coffee is to use some sort of
practical
examples here right let's take what
we've discussed so far
and apply it to some real world examples
this is a canyon coffee it's from the
supermarket strength three
so it's gonna be the lighter roast that
you would get at a supermarket because
two and one
don't really exist it's saying zesty
citrus
and blackberry they are broadcasting to
you that this is going to be a
light to medium-bodied coffee it's going
to have for them
a lot of acidity but those fruits are
kind of clean fruit tastes
it's not kind of funky fruit that's what
they're telling you about this coffee
and from that perspective you may love
or loathe the experience that is coming
now this lavazza rosso very popular with
a lot of people description
rich and full bodied with chocolate
notes so they are saying to you
this is a heavy bodied coffee right
there's going to be very little acidity
there's no
fruit words in here whatsoever so
they're saying no to low acidity
lots and lots of body lots of texture uh
they're saying intensity
five out of ten roasting medium so
you're not expecting a ton of kind of
bitterness or kind of harsher
more kind of developed roast flavors but
it's still going to be a big kind of
heavy-bodied experience
back to this bag which i picked up
before it's a coffee from china which is
interesting
now this is described as kind of nutty
and sweet here they say cherry
almond candied orange and caramel right
it's a medium roast
so what i'm expecting is reasonable
texture actually like a
some nice body it's a washed coffee but
i wouldn't expect it to be light-bodied
in addition it has some fruit but
they're pushing towards kind of
cooked fruit candied fruit in a way so i
would expect some acidity
but not that much and i wouldn't expect
any fermented flavors in this from
their particular description so you know
i can kind of understand am i likely to
enjoy this or am i not
so this one is really interesting to me
because this is a very big coffee
company called taylor's of harrogate
very large uk company one of the biggest
roasters in the uk
doing specialty coffee now this is
listed right in the front as a natural
so straight away we know we're in for
some funky flavors
we look at the back of the bag yeah it
says pineapple
coconut and whiskey this is going to be
a strongly fermented
tasting coffee right it says natural
process it's roasted for filter it tells
us that and it also says it's a light
roast
so we've got a lot of information
natural processed coffees don't often
have the same acidity as washed coffees
but still if you don't like acidity
they're saying probably avoid this
coffee and if you don't like fermented
flavors then probably avoid this coffee
but if you like those two things
this might be a pretty safe bet if you
know if you're buying it off the shelf
especially if you're spending a little
bit of money now in some cases
you may not have any descriptors on a
bag but generally speaking
specialty roasters are wise enough to
the whole fermented flavors thing
that they will say if it's a natural or
not and so here we know that it is a
natural processed coffee
so from that word alone you can make a
pretty informed decision around your
preferences around those styles of
flavors
and then one more one more so here it's
an espresso roast so we'd expect it to
be darker and it is strength four so
they're suggesting
it's gonna be pretty darkly roasted not
all the way to very roasted but
pretty dark
descriptors of rich chocolate spice and
toffee
so no fruit words there whatsoever we're
gonna expect really pretty low acidity
they're offering you know by the
description some kind of sweetness there
but ultimately it's not going to be a
you know
a fruity or in any way acidic espresso i
think it's going to be more kind of
medium-bodied but relatively high
bitterness and low acid
that's the sort of subtext of this whole
thing so that i hope is a really useful
guide to help you buy
better coffees but now i want to hear
from you down in the comments below
what did i miss out on what more
information would be useful to you
when it comes to buying a bag of coffee
and feeling confident that you're really
going
to enjoy it let me know down in the
comments below
but for now i'll say thank you so much
for watching and i hope you have a great
day
