## How I Dial-In Espresso - Part #1

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFwJF-_SUr0>

Today, I'm gonna talk to you about
how I dial in an espresso.
What I've got in my hopper here,
is a coffee I've never used before.
I've never tasted it.
I don't really know how to dial it in,
the grinder's definitely
not set up for it.
So I'm gonna go through
the process of dialing in,
going through adjusting my dose,
my grind, my recipe, my ins, my outs.
All of those things to get the
best tasting shot that I can.
Now, the audio in here is not great,
so I'm gonna be talking to you afterwards,
talking you through the process
and I'll try and capture as much as I can
of what's going on here
behind the machine.
So this is the setup.
I'm using a Mythos One and
using a Black Eagle Gravitech
and a little old house
there to track my doses.
It's an 18 grand BST basket in there
so I'm going to dose about 18 grams
disturbing the poke with a teaspoon
like this is not ideal, but
if you're trying to get
somewhere quickly, it's okay
as a way to kind of trim your dose down
without messing with the copy too much.
I'll explain more about
this particular technique
a little bit later in the video.
Now, this coffee, I had a quick look at
at the start and it was
pretty light, right?
So I could see for espresso,
it was going to be a challenge.
I didn't know much about it
it was a single origin coffee
but it was a pretty light roast.
So this first shot, I'm
just going to see what I get
you know, see what the grind
is, see where everything is,
that's my starting point.
Now this shot was
bad.
If you look at the recipe, you're talking
about 18 grams in 40
grams out in 34 seconds.
So my gut feeling was that
would be a little bit slow,
taste-wise harsh, muddy,
intensely sour, unpleasant
not at all good and
the aftertaste was bad.
We've brewed too slow.
I wouldn't say necessarily
overly under extracted
but it's just not a
particularly delicious espresso.
So I'm going to go a little bit coarser
I'm going to keep the dose at about 18.
I'm going to aim for
about 38 out and I'm just
going to track my runtime
to see where my grind is.
Like I'm looking for something
in the very late twenties
I suspect to taste good
but that's just, you know, typical
of my kind of setup and my
kind of espresso preference.
So let's see how this one brews.
The shot finishes in about 25 seconds
and it doesn't taste good,
it definitely tastes under extracted.
We've definitely brushed too fast.
I have made too big
of an adjustment to my
grind I've gone too coarse.
So that's what I'm going to do now.
I'm going to work on
just moving that grind
just fractionally finer to get me closer
to where I want to be.
Again everything else I'm
really going to keep the same.
So here's shot number three.
And just by going that little bit finer
we've gone a little bit slower,
we're at like a 27 second brew time now,
just a little slower
but definitely more extracted,
the espresso did taste better
a little bit more extracted,
a bit more balanced
but it's not quite there yet.
Again, I'm going to take my
grind up just a little bit finer here
I feel like I'm trending
in the right direction,
shots are tasting better.
I just want to up that
extraction a little bit more.
Now at at 18
in 38 39 out in 29 seconds,
it's looking pretty good.
The shot isn't bad by any stretch
but I still feel it could be improved.
I'd still like to get
more extraction out of it.
So as I'm cleaning up
here, I'm thinking about it
and I'm thinking, why don't
I just keep the grind where it is
and just push a little bit
more liquid through it.
I'm using the little
decent dosing funnel just
to help redistribute the coffee.
If it's not perfectly distributed
coming out of the grinder
that just helps provide a
more, even bed before tamping.
So all I'm going to do is,
is basically repeat the shot
but let it go from 38, up to 42 grams
that's going to give me
more liquid in the cup.
I'm going to lose some concentration
but I'm happy to trade that off
for a bit more extraction and
a little bit more sweetness.
And this shot, this shot
is really pretty good.
I enjoyed the shot, it had good clarity.
It still had enough texture
it was on the more acidic end
but ultimately that's the
raw material that I'm working
with in this situation
with a lighter roast
I should have realistic expectations
about how much acidity I'm going to have
in my balanced end espresso.
Now I do think I can improve this recipe
a little bit further.
I think there's one last
change that's worth making
before I make that change.
I'm just going to tell you
about this video sponsor,
which is Skillshare.
Now Skillshare is an
online learning community
with thousands of classes
covering different creative
and entrepreneurial skills.
I'm a Skillshare premium member
and that means that for my $10 a month
if I sign up annually, I get access
to literally every single
course it's unlimited access
which I think is fantastic.
Now I definitely use Skillshare
to help improve my video
making skills, to improve my approach
to producing better videos for you.
But there's a lot more
to it than that at the
moment I'm enjoying Thomas
Frank's productivity masterclass.
This is the kind
of class we'll pick up
something in every section
one little thing to improve
the way that you work.
And I would recommend it really highly
but you don't have to take my word for it.
Because Skillshare is
sponsoring this video,
you can sign up with the link
in my description and you get
two months free Skillshare
unlimited access to everything there.
Thanks to Skillshare for
sponsoring this video.
And so we're back to this final change.
Now, one thing I want
to do is actually just
drop my dose a little bit more.
I want to up the extraction
here a little bit more.
So I'm going to go a little finer again.
I'm going to go from 18 down to about 17
but I'm still going to
aim for 42 grams out.
So again, this is a much
weaker kind of recipe here
but I think I'll be
rewarded with a little bit
more extraction using this coffee
makes extraction a little easier.
I can go finer, there's
less coffee to extract
and by using this higher ratio,
I stand a much better chance
of getting a more balanced espresso here
and that's what I got.
This was super drinkable,
super tasty, sweet, clean
not a ton of texture, but
enough to still feel satisfying.
Now when making this video
it became clear that
this is just one coffee.
This is just one opportunity
and I can't really get into every aspect
of dialing in without exploring
lots of different coffees
lots of different styles of espresso.
So I'm going to make this a
series, this is the first part.
This covers a kind of light roast
high grown single origin espresso.
And in future
I'm going to tackle
different styles of coffee
and change the way that I
dial in around those things.
So that's the idea behind the series.
I would love your feedback on it.
I'd love to hear your
questions, your thoughts
what kind of coffees you want me to dig
into and dial in and
explore a little bit more.
I would really love to hear your thoughts
as always thank you so much
for watching and I hope
you have a great day.
