A Beginner's Guide to Coffee Grinders

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgjvLQu5NlE&t=23s>

Welcome to today's video,
which is a beginner's guide
to coffee grinders.
Because there's a lot of different
coffee grinders out there
which is the right one for you?
Which one meets your needs?
Which is the best value for money?
Now, what we're gonna do today
is cover a little bit
of theory at the start
on coffee grinding, right?
Understanding what's going on,
why it's something worth worrying about,
why it's something we're spending money
on a bit of equipment to do it.
And then in the second half,
we'll talk through all
of these grinders here
and talk through the
features that you get,
what happens when you spend more money
and you, I hope at the end of it,
will feel well-equipped
to buy a coffee grinder
that meets your needs
and have even better tasting
coffee every morning.
One quick thing,
I'm not gonna necessarily
recommend specific models,
nor review specific models in this video.
Where I've talked about grinders before
they'll be links down in the description,
you can watch those.
I've done a number of different videos
on particular grinders.
Today, these are kind of
representative grinders
of different technologies
or different features
just to kind of explain what's happening
when you spend more money.
But let's start with the theory.
Let's start with what
happens when we grind coffee.
Why we grind coffee in the first place.
Now our whole coffee bean
is a wonderful thing,
but it doesn't make a good tasting coffee.
Water cannot get to all of the flavor
'cause it could only sort of get
to the very outside of the bean.
And so if you put whole beans in hot water
some flavor will come out,
but really not very much.
And so we grind it, we smash
it into little tiny pieces
because what we're concerned
about first and foremost
is exposing sort of more surface area.
And the finer you grind anything,
the more surface area that you have,
and the easier it is for
the water to get in there,
dissolve the flavor out, get
it into your cup of coffee
and for you to have a better
more delicious cup at the end of it.
Now, one of the big sells you'll hear
for a coffee grinder is that freshness
is actually a really key
aspect of grinding coffee.
And that's true, when you smash coffee,
you expose all of the surface area
and it means everything
that you've exposed
can begin to go stale.
And there are three ways
in which coffee goes stale.
The first and to me kind of saddest
is the idea that you
just lose those flavors.
They go, what's called volatilely,
float off into the atmosphere
and those flavors and aromas
essentially wander off.
You'll smell them for a minute
and then you won't get
to drink them later.
So that's kind of a thing.
So the older coffee is the more flavor
essentially just loses to
the air, to the atmosphere.
The second thing that happens
is that you have what are
called sort of staling reactions
where different compounds
combine with each other
and begin to create new flavors
that often aren't particularly nice.
And so after a little while
your coffee will taste measurably worse
as well as being less interesting.
And then the third thing is oxidation.
And that'll happen to
sort of some of the fats
and oils inside coffee,
they will oxidize and
essentially begin to go rancid.
It's not a great smell
or taste rancid oil,
and rancid oil in all forms
smells a little bit fishy
and that's true with coffee.
So very old, very stale, rancid coffee
is not something I would recommend.
And the best way to
avoid all of those things
is really only to smash
the coffee bean to pieces
when you want to immediately then brew it,
that way you capture a lot more flavor,
you have less loss of quality,
it's just a better time all around.
Now occasionally on the internet
you'll see a thing that
says pre-ground coffee
from a very, very, very
good commercial grinder
will make better coffee in many cases,
than fresh ground coffee
from a very cheap coffee grinder.
And that's an interesting
test and study that was done.
I think it ignores some
of the other reasons
to buy a coffee grinder.
We'll get to in a second,
but really what isn't to be underestimated
is just the pleasure of grinding coffee.
In that moment, there
is an enormous release
of smell that is fantastic.
That moment of grinding coffee
bit in the morning, first
thing, or in the afternoon
it's a pleasure not to be missed.
So from that perspective alone,
a coffee grinder is worth having.
And if you own a pepper
grinder of any kind,
then you owe it to yourself
to own a coffee grinder too,
if you drink coffee.
Now, the second thing that
gets talked about a lot
is called grind uniformity.
And that's the idea that
when you grind coffee,
ideally, the little pieces that you make
should all be the same size.
Because when you come
to prepare them later,
brew them into a cup of coffee,
the more uniform the size is, the better
they'll give up their flavor
in a more uniform way.
And that makes sense from
anything in the kitchen
if you're trying to cook some potatoes,
if you cook a little tiny piece of potato
and a whole potato, they'll
cook at very different rates
and they probably won't
cook well together.
Same thing with coffee grinding, right?
If you are trying to brew
loads of little tiny pieces
of coffee, alongside loads
of very big pieces of coffee,
you'll get a lot of flavor
out of the tiny pieces
and not very much out of the other pieces.
And this can result in a very unbalanced,
unpleasant cup of coffee.
Those tiny pieces can add some bitterness,
those giant pieces can add some sourness,
and those two things combined
are not how I wanna start my day.
So as we talk through grinders
you'll hear me reference this
idea of grind uniformity.
And it is important,
it helps you make better tasting coffee
to have the pieces be a very similar size.
You'll have less unbalanced,
less unpleasant cups of coffee,
more delicious cups of coffee.
Now the third aspect of coffee grinders
that's very important of coffee grinding
that's very important
is grind size control.
The ideal grind size for espresso
is very different from
the ideal grind size
for something like a French
press, for example, right?
With espresso, you want lots and lots
of very fine small pieces
because you're gonna extract that coffee
with very little liquid
to make it very strong.
With a French press,
you might wanna grind it
a little bit coarser.
So being able to control the grind size
is really, really, really important,
particularly so in espresso,
but we'll touch on that
a little bit later.
So that's it, that's the key information
to think about as we go into looking
at these different grinders,
it'll help us to understand
why you might wanna spend a
bit more money here or there.

that, there's a quick ad

for sponsoring this video.
So let's start with these
10 grinders in front of me.
Let's start at the beginning
with the cheapest grinder on offer,
which is this it's a blade grinder.
And these can be had for like 20 pounds,
they're very cheap,
they're very simple things.
You've got a little motor
and that's attached to some
spinning blades inside here.
And when you turn the grinder on
they spin really, really quickly
and essentially those blades,
they're not really sharp
they kind of just smash the
coffee down into little pieces.
The longer you run it, the
finer the coffee will be.
But the problem with these,
is that you really don't have any control
meaningfully over grind size.
To have really the same grind size
every time is quite tricky,
and to have a uniform grind
size is extremely unlikely.
This kind of act of violence
of just smashing the coffee
beans instead of cutting them
creates a lot of very fine pieces
that can add a lot of
muddiness and bitterness
and kind of dullness to your
cup of coffee in the morning.
I'm not saying you can't enjoy coffee
made with a blade grinder,
and there's some hacks you can do too
to improve the quality of its output
that's linked up here.
If you're enjoying coffee
with a blade grinder now,
you could really, really
be enjoying your coffee
a lot more with a better grinder
that offers you a little bit
more control and uniformity.
If you own one of these and
you're upgrading from it,
do not throw it away
they make for fantastic spice grinders,
they are useful to have around.
But to grind coffee
they are a little bit frustrating.
So then we move from what
are called blade grinders
into the rest of these, which
are called burr grinders.
So inside these, you've
got two cutting discs,
one spins against the other
and controlling the
distance between the two
controls how big the pieces
are when they finally get out
of the grinder into the
collection bin below
where you're gonna sort of take them
and then pour them into your brewery
or whatever you're gonna do with them.
This is a classic kind of
entry-level hand grinder.
It's relatively cheap,
it's about 40 pounds.
And a lot of people choose to start
their sort of grinding journey
here with one of these 'cause
it's not a huge investment.
And that's true, you'll have some control
of the grind setting.
In something like this,
you kind of control the burr distance.
This is a conical burr grinder.
So you've got a kind of
cone-shaped main burr
that spins inside this thing.
Conical burrs are popular
and a lot of grinders
they have a larger cutting surface
which helps you to kind
of grind more coffee
through kind of per turn, which is useful.
This is in contrast to what
are called flat burr grinders.
We have two discs or
rings of cutting teeth,
one spins against the other,
same control mechanism
you just move them further apart
for a coarser grind or closer
together for a finer grind.
Now the burrs and cheaper
hand grinders especially
tend to be made of ceramic.
This is a cheaper material to produce.
They don't cut quite as cleanly.
So your grind uniformity
isn't quite as good
as a metal burr,
but as an entry-level
thing, they work okay.
What you tend to see also
in cheaper burr grinders
is a little bit of wobbling
from that bottom burrs that's grinding.
'Cause it's not stabilized super well
because they're trying to keep costs down.
That will also result in a
less uniform cup of coffee.
So if you look at going from say 40 pounds
up to 100 pounds, right?
You've got the same basic technology.
You're gonna be doing the work here.
You are turning, you're
working to crush the coffee
between those burrs.
Now, here you go from
a plastic construction
to a metal construction,
and you go from ceramic
burrs to metal burrs.
So it's a big jump in quality
going from 40 pounds to say 100 pounds.
Now with the previous grinder
and this grinder and the next grinder too,
they are what's called stepped grinders,
where you adjust the
grind here at the bottom
by fixed amounts.
This is sort of a step that
kind of clicks into place.
And that's a controlled movement.
That means that you've
got pretty good control
of a ground size, but not
infinite control in a way.
And later on, we'll talk
about stepless grinders.
But for the purposes here,
steps work very well,
they're repeatable,
they're useful to have.
This will do a better job grinding coffee
than the 40 pound grinder,
by a good amount actually.
By not needing a motor, by
having you do the hard work
you can kind of invest a
bit more in the other things
like the burr quality and get
better results for less money.
The downside of course, is that
you have to do the grinding
every time, every morning.
And if you're growing a lot of coffee
that can take a while and it is hard work
grinding the coffee is
relatively physical.
That can change with
more expensive grinders
or bigger grinders,
but ultimately hand grinding
is something you have
to kind of enjoy doing.
As you go from 100 pounds
up to something much more expensive
in the hand grinder world,
generally, you're getting
an increase in construction.
Again, this is better made,
this feels solid, it's great materials,
but really you're could be paying
for better grind uniformity.
And that's what more expensive
hand grinders generally offer.
And at this price point
the grinds coming from
this are very, very good.
And you can grind effectively
for espresso with an
expensive hand grinder,
it's really hard work, but you can do it
or you can grind for
filter coffee pretty well.
So that's kind of what you've
spent with hand grinders
going from something pretty cheap,
cheaper materials,
cheaper burr construction,
less uniformity, and
that's what's increased
as you've gone up and up and up.
So there are lots of reasons
to have a hand grinder.
It might be that you travel a lot,
it might be that you like camping,
it might be that just you
enjoy that whole thing.
But if you are at home
you're grinding coffee every single day,
then I would recommend investing
in an electric coffee grinder.
And that's where we start here.
So this grinder here is
cheaper than this hand grinder.
It's a little bit more expensive
than this grinder here,
but it's a great way to start the day.
You have an electric motor in there
and that spinning a conical burr set.
And that's what you tend to see
at entry-level decent home
electric grinder price points.
Now cheaper grinders
will have cheaper motors
and because grinding coffee is hard work,
a cheaper motor will overcome
the sort of power needed
to crush those beans
by just spinning faster.
So you'll tend to see cheaper grinders
have faster RPMs on their motors.
They don't always grind coffee
through the burrs quicker,
but they will generally
be a little bit louder.
That motor spinning generates some noise,
if it's spinning very fast,
the way it cuts coffee
you'll just get a bit
more noise in the morning.
This grinder, as you tend
to see at this price point
is a stepped grinder.
So you've got fixed steps
and it's not really able
to do espresso, right?
We talked about having a cheaper motor
spinning a bit faster,
but when you're grinding
very, very, very fine
you need a lot of power,
you need a lot of talk in that motor
and cheaper motors just can't do it.
So you tend to see cheaper
grinders like this are great
if you need filter coffee,
but not great if you're
trying to brew espresso.
If you look at say a
filter dedicated grinder
at about 125 pounds going
up to say 250 pounds,
then you see a variation in the features
that's kind of interesting.
This grinder was initially designed
to hold like a bag of
coffee in the hopper here
and have a little timer on the side
that you would adjust it, you'd push go
and it would grind for
a fixed amount of time
to dispense the amount of
coffee that you wanted.
But that's not how many people
want a coffee grinder to work.
You want what's called
a single dose grinder.
Where you're gonna put in what you need
and no more in terms of coffee beans
for that drink, that batch,
whatever it's gonna be.
It might be that you wanna
keep the coffee stored
and sealed away and not
sitting in the grinder.
It might be that have more
than one coffee at home
and you wanna vary one bean to the next.
A grinder like this is designed
to be a single-dose grinder.
You can't really fit that
much coffee on the top here,
so you'd only pour in what you'd need.
Instead of having a timer
this has an auto shutoff
that stops the grinder
when it's no longer grinding coffee.
This grinder, like this
grinder is a stepped grinder.
So you've got fixed increments
that you can adjust the grind size by.
And this grinder is also a
filter coffee only grinder,
it's motor it's set up
is really built around
filter coffee and not espresso.
What you tended to see historically
was when you need espresso
you had a dedicated
espresso style grinder.
And this is a pretty good example.
It's a bit of a jump in price
because you've got a more
substantial motor in there
and this is about I think 350 pounds
which is some pretty serious money.
Now this is designed really
to be a dedicated espresso grinder.
And it's a little bit more
traditional in its design,
which means it's got a large hopper on top
to again, hold a big bag
of coffee beans in there
and grind what you need when you need it.
Many people choose not
to do that as I said,
and use this as single dose,
though you'd probably
wanna replace this hopper
with something more appropriate.
What you see as you go
from a filter coffee
dedicated grinder to an
espresso dedicated grinder
is not just the ability to grind finer,
but you tend to see
stepless adjustment, right?
Where you control the
finest or the coarseness
it's usually just a wheel
that you can move as little
or as much as you want.
Espresso requires very small
adjustments to grind in size
to have quite a substantial change
in the way that the coffee brews.
So you want as much
control as is possible.
So that's what you tend to see
in a dedicated espresso grinder.
This will grind using time.
So you push go and it'll
grind for say 9.2 seconds
to give you a consistent dose of coffee.
This kind of grinder, you
can buy in a huge number
of different configurations
from different manufacturers.
You'll have different motor sizes,
different burrs sizes,
different burr shapes,
you know, different kind of technologies
controlling how much coffee
it grinds as it grinds.
But the base principle is kind of there.
If you're grinding for espresso
you need that more powerful motor
and that tends to mean you
need to spend more money
and that's where your money is going.
Now, these two grinders are emblematic
of more modern approaches to grinders.
This kind of grinder has existed
for 60, if not 70 years now.
These are much newer,
as you'll see they're both
grind to order grinders
they have no real space
to hold much coffee,
they'll hold a single dose under no more,
but they're also designed
to go all the way
from coarser filter grinds
through to very fine espresso grinds.
This one is a flat burr grinder
and this one is a conical burr grinder.
This one is a little bit cheaper
I think at about 400 pounds,
this one is a little bit
more expensive at 500 pounds.
Feature wise, they're both very similar
you're grinding into a
little collection bin
that you might then use
to pour into a pour-over
or pour directly into a portafilter
if you're making a espresso.
Now the difference of
price between the two
might come down to the design
and construction of these,
the materials used or the components used,
it might also come down
to their approach to
things like retention.
Now retention isn't something
that we've talked about yet
but it is something that's
actually very important
and you'll see discussed
in a lot of different grinder reviews.
When you put coffee beans into a grinder
it'll go into a chamber
that holds the cutting discs
those spin, those push out the grounds,
ideally all of them,
but typically not quite all of them.
There might be anywhere from
0.2 of a gram to two grams
or even sometimes more
stuck inside the grinder
that the mechanism is unable
to completely push out.
Now with more traditional
designs like this one
that wasn't considered a huge issue
because, you know, it'll be pushed out
when you grind for coffee the next time.
The downside is when you change your grind
you'll have some of the
retained old grind setting
that you would need to purge out.
That's a little bit wasteful
and the more you need to
purge out with a grinder,
the more wasteful that grinder is.
Some commercial grinders can
need 20 or 30 grams purging,
not acceptable, but that's how
things were for a long time.
More modern solutions might
need a couple of grams,
if anything at all.
So design around retention
is really a key thing.
Here you've got quite
a different approach,
the retention is dealt with
by the sort of innate design
of the burr chamber.
Here you've got a bellows
where you'd push down that would blow air
through the grinding chamber
pushing out the last bit of coffee
into the collection cup below.
That's the kind of idea there.
How a grinder deals with retention,
be it bellows or be it a little knocker
on the side of it is something
you should think about,
and decide how you wanna spend your money
because it will impact your
kind of workflow in the morning.
Do you wanna have to go and
clack a thing a few times
or press the bellows a few times?
If it doesn't bother you
and it saves you some money,
then it's worth considering.
But retention is important
and retention is discussed a lot
when you watch other reviews
of grinders on YouTube
or read about them on websites.
So the understanding I think
is really, really, really key.
Now, one last note on
conical versus flat burrs
and I don't want to get too deeply
into an esoteric discussion here,
but some people believe that conical burrs
suit espresso a little bit more.
That having a little bit more
diversity of size of particle
can help give some more texture,
some more body to your espresso.
Other people prefer sort
of flat burr style espresso
where you have a little bit more clarity,
maybe more sweetness, but
not quite as much texture.
Understanding that is a consideration
if you're getting into the fine end
of dialing into espresso,
when you've got a great machine
and you want a great grinder to match it.
But if it's your first grinder
it's not something you
necessarily need to obsess
about until your technique
and other aspects of coffee
making catch up to that.
Now, one last note on
burrs is that some grinders
have options for different
burrs that you can install.
Grinders like this or this,
you can install different burrs
from different manufacturers
that will give you different results.
If you are shopping for a grinder
and you're kind of wanting
to future-proof it,
considering a grinder
that has some options
for a grinder burrs is one thing
to maybe just bear in
mind as you're shopping.
That's not essential, but it
is a kind of nice to have,
if you're thinking about buying a grinder
that's gonna last you
for a really long time
without worrying about
needing to constantly upgrade.
Now, these nine grinders I have here
are I think viable first-time purchases,
even though we've gone all
the way up to 500 pounds.
I could see this still being
someone's first coffee grinder at home.
I did want to include a little bit more
just to explain how
people can end up spending
enormous amounts of
money on coffee grinders
for what they're chasing.
Now, this grinder in the
end is incredibly expensive
it's three and a half thousand dollars
but I think it's a good example
of how far people will go
in the chase for better
uniformity, better construction
or better design or
better build, more control
here you've got variable RPM.
I can change the speed of my motor
to achieve different
results in how it grinds.
The workflow is kind of
different and very nice.
It's beautiful, I can easily
switch the burrs out in it.
You know, these kind of details
are what you end up paying for.
Now understand that going from
a more entry-level grinder
to something like this
is a big leap in quality
and a great return on your investment.
Going from someone like this,
up to someone like this,
is an increasing quality,
but it's a smaller leap,
it's more incremental
increase for a lot more money.
And that's true of most
things in this world, right?
Like the closer you get
to sort of the end goal,
the more expensive and the more difficult
it is to do any sort of an upgrade.
I'm not saying this is
bad value for money,
but if you're looking at spending
a lot of money on the coffee grinder,
you really have to have
some very specific problems
that only it will solve for you.
As a final note, these look like they go
from sort of the lowest
quality to the highest quality,
but that isn't quite true.
Hand grinders are a cheaper
way to achieve better quality,
better grind uniformity at lower prices
'cause you don't have to
spend money on the motor,
so you're just spending on burr
and construction generally.
So that is the beginner's
guide to coffee grinders.
And it's there a hope to help
you build a little flow chart
for you and your needs and your budget.
If you've got 300 pounds
and you want a filter coffee grinder,
then I can help you get
to where you need to go
based on your needs.
Do you want absolute quality for the money
or do you want electric motor
to help you do some of the work?
These are questions I
can't answer for you,
but hopefully now you can
answer them for yourself
and make a better decision.
And do know there are still things
that we haven't talked about here
that are little details
that are worth looking out for in reviews.
Things like the, not just
the loudness of a grinder,
but the quality of sound.
Does it great on you?
That kind of stuff.
Things like the user interface,
does it frustrate you?
Is it quirky?
Is it frustrating?
Is it finicky?
Those things are important
and should be looked out for
when you're checking out a
review before you purchase.
But now I wanna hear from you
down in the comments below.
Do you have one of these?
Are you thinking about
upgrading to one of these?
What are you looking
for in a coffee grinder?
And how has this video
potentially helped you
make a better decision?
I'd love your feedback,
I'd love your thoughts.
But for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching
and I hope you have a great day.
