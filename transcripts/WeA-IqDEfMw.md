## The Option-O Lagom P-64 (Episode #1)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeA-IqDEfMw>

today we're going to be reviewing
this it is the legom p64 by option o
this is episode one of six of a kind of
ultimate
grinder showdown week we're going to
review five grinders over five days and
on the sixth day we'll do a big
head-to-head showdown that'll answer a
bunch of questions that these little
reviews
won't yet have answered so let's start
with the lagom
p64 and i have to say i like this
grinder
it is small it is neat it is compact it
is very well built
it has a lot of things about it that i
really really like now the lagom
p64 is a recent launch for a company
called option o
option o itself is a merger of two
companies one originally called option o
and the other called hilo
you might be familiar with hilo from a
previous hand grinder showdown video
where we reviewed one of their grinders
and it was very nicely made
this is their kind of first high-end
domestic
single-dose electric grinder and they've
done i think
a very good job with it now when i
bought it
i paid 1585
that seems like a lot of money but know
that over the next four or five days
we're going to be talking about grinders
at least twice as expensive so this is
actually
the cheapest of the grinders in this
particular series i will say that if you
go to their website
it does annoy me that it initially looks
like the grinder is 600
that's the deposit that you would pay to
sort of get in line to get a unit and
the pricing for me
is not particularly transparent and i
didn't love that about the experience
back to the grinder itself firstly i had
to make a decision on ordering about
which bursat went inside
and this is going to be an issue that's
going to come up over and over
and over again over the next few videos
when i'm reviewing the espresso or the
coffee coming out of these grinders
am i reviewing the grinder or the burst
set
and and pulling those two things apart
is tricky especially when
you can pick different burst sets on
ordering inside the grinder now
are the high uniformity birds from ssp i
also purchased
the unimodal burs from ssp these kind of
terminologies can be a little confusing
essentially unimodal means there is one
big peak in the distribution of grinds
essentially it is a more even
burst there are a number of people who
believe that
unimodal is the best for everything and
then there are people who believe that
for espresso
there can be some drawbacks and so
because i wanted to do a lot of espresso
testing with this
i picked the high uniformity which are
pretty uniform but not as uniform as the
unimodal burs
i do want to talk just quickly about
using this grinder for filter coffee
generally the experience has been very
good and i even
quite like the filter brews out of the
high uniformity burs
that they're certainly better i think as
birds than say conical bursts
for filter coffee if i was using this
for nothing but filter coffee
then yeah i definitely put in the
unimodal burs from ssp as an option
and i'd be very happy with this as a
filter coffee grinder i think it works
it works very well those burs are an
additional 200
on top of the price point they would
argue and talk about this in a little
bit
that because it's easy to access the
burs the idea of changing your births
intermittently depending on the kind of
phase of coffee drinking that you're
going through
is not unrealistic sometimes you're in
an espresso phase and you're drinking
loads of espresso drinks and sometimes
you're in a brewed coffee phase and you
may be not brewing as much espresso
if you're only brewing espresso at home
then i would recommend the high
uniformity burst if you're brewing only
filter coffee then i would recommend the
unimodal burs
and if you're split between the two
that's much more difficult for me to
answer
but we'll do a load of taste testing in
the showdown at the end of this week
where we compare all the different
grinders and we'll touch on brewed
coffee with the different burst sets as
well as espresso too so before we get
into using the grinder
we do have to talk through the
accessories that it comes with and it
comes with
a good number of them on the front here
you can see the dosing cup
so this is designed if you're going to
brew some filter coffee you would grind
into this it sort of sits underneath
there
it's nice it's neat it's clearly a
custom piece it's pretty heavy actually
it's pretty big as well which is kind of
interesting um
but it's very nicely made it feels
chunky and solid i don't particularly
understand why there's a gap here
it doesn't sit any closer to the exit
depending which way around you put it so
i guess i don't know someone in the
comments will tell me why i'm an idiot
and that's okay
next up you've got your funnel that sits
on top of your portafilter to help with
sort of dosing and making sure
everything goes in nicely and accurately
again
quite nicely made just uh machined out
at the bottom there just to sit over a
58 mil
portafilter you get a wdt tool a wise
distribution technique tool
which is essentially designed to help
stir out any clumps in the grounds you
do get a little dosing cup that you'd
wear your beans out in this
in comparison to the other pieces that
are custom feels
off the shelf and kind of cheap it feels
like a thing that ketchup comes in
in in kind of bars and pubs when they
you know what i mean like it's it's
i don't know i don't love this it feels
oddly cheap for the rest of the setup
and then a little spray bottle and if
you don't know why this is here
check the video up here and all will be
explained there is a little brush to
keep things clean
and over here again i've got my extra
burs but that's basically what this
thing
comes with now what i'll do is i'll pull
a shot and i'll talk you through
what i like and what i don't like a
little bit more as part of that process
i would absolutely recommend using the
little tool they recommend a couple of
sprays
and that's generally been fine for me
now one of my first complaints
porter filter in hand is the portafilter
fork so
this is designed again for 58 mil
portafilters if they're offset like this
one that's not really a problem they do
still fit
perfectly fine and it sits in there and
it holds it i will say with this kind of
a portafilter i've had absolutely no
issues i'll show you an issue i've had
with the decent sport filter in a little
bit
in terms of usability on the front here
you've got your grind setting
and on the side here you have a little
knob that changes the rpm of the grinder
i've generally used it with the rpm
sitting somewhere in the middle not at
the highest and certainly not at the
lowest
the concept of varying rpms in grinders
is maybe worthy of an
entirely different video it's a kind of
unknown territory and i don't want to
get too much into it
today so let's get on and pull a shot
with this thing we'll run the grinder
it's very quiet nowhere we go
some people like to just tap the top to
act as a little bellows type system
they certainly don't recommend using
proper bellows to blow a lot of air
through so a little tap on top has
generally been fine
and there we go the distribution in
portafilter from the grinder is
good if not completely fantastic i think
it does benefit from additional
distribution
with their tool or something else just
to make sure you've broken up any clumps
and the coffee is more evenly
distributed
across the bed and that's ready to go
now with the high uniformity bursts
which are the kind of espresso bur sets
then you can work with kind of more
traditional ratios one to two one to two
and a half generally has tasted very
good there
it's had that nice mixture of good
extraction and good texture which
i think is a really important part of
espresso this one
delicious super good how it will do in
comparative testing later on
is hard to say without doing the testing
but as an isolated single espresso
that is tasty complex balanced
textured it's a really enjoyable shot
so let's talk through a few things that
i like and also a few things that i
don't like
what i like i like the burrs in this i
really like the style of espresso that
this produces i like that more
textured shot rather than that kind of
unimodal shot that has a lot of clarity
but maybe not as much body
i know the birds are 64 mil and that's
relatively small for high-end
single-dose grinders
but i don't think you're massively
compromising your experience
we'll see how they stack up in direct
competition later but but i think they
produce very enjoyable
coffee if i'm reviewing the burst set in
that regard the design and build are
great
i think it looks extremely good i like
it in matte black i think it looks good
in the silver option as well
i don't particularly like this rubber
thing that comes with it
it seems unnecessary and oddly ugly for
the machine as a whole
i generally have used it without this on
there but otherwise i think the design
is extremely pleasant
the construction's solid it's heavy
enough to feel well made but not so
heavy that it's irritating to move
around
it is exceptionally quiet i i think it's
shockingly quiet in some regards
i've left this on when we've been sort
of making coffee here and it's been a
bit noisy
and not really noticed until i've come
back i think the workflow is
good i think the forks work mostly well
enough
i think using it is completely fine and
i also do like that you can access the
burst set
without tools you'll still need some
tools to unscrew the burrs but you can
access the burs
simply by unscrewing this sort of top
part of the chamber here
now for a few things that i don't like
as much firstly
the numbers on here there is a rule with
coffee grinders that i've experienced in
my life
almost every single grinder i've ever
used has abided by this rule
which is if you go from four to three
moving to a smaller number
takes you to a finer ground setting this
disobeys that rule and i find it
maddening it's a personal thing
but i simply don't understand why going
to a larger number
would make it a finer ground setting i
do not get it
it just wrecks my head it's a nice
mechanism it's stepless all of those
things are good i just wish the numbers
went the other way
weird complaint but but really does
bother me
in terms of dials i'm also kind of
annoyed by the dial
for rpm on the side it runs from one to
nine
but that correlates to going from 200 to
1400 rpm
that makes no sense to me again it's
very frustrating why not just write
the rpm numbers on the dial and let me
choose my rpm
rather than some strange arbitrary
number that doesn't seem to
obviously correlate to the rpm that i'm
choosing i guess that the number itself
isn't that important
but at the same time that just seems
like a weird decision to me
i'm not completely enamored with this
dosing cup it just feels very big
and very heavy and i don't particularly
like the kind of metal or metal
lumpkin on the top thing i just don't
feel
that good about it this sort of exit
funnel of this thing
just about fits inside a 58mm
portafilter so if you
wanted to improve distribution and
declumping by grinding into this
shaking and then dosing into a
portafilter a little bit like you can
with something like the niche
that doesn't work super well here and in
my opinion you could have gone just a
little bit smaller to accommodate
something like a 57mm portafilter
and made that workflow a little bit
easier for people i wish you could take
some of the the metal and machining and
effort that went into this
and and put it into this make this a bit
lighter make this a bit heavier
just just make it all a bit more
balanced and matching
i'm being fussy but that's kind of my
job lastly my other big complaint really
is the portafilter forks they are
designed to be universal and nothing
that is universal fits everything
perfectly for example using the decent
portafilter you can have a little bit of
an issue
let me show you the lugs on the decent
support filter seem to be just a little
bit narrower so when this is in place
you have a little bit more play that can
cause
a terribly messy thing to happen
[Laughter]
less than ideal so you really have to
pay attention half the time it doesn't
happen but sometimes if it's not
completely seated it will just vibrate
itself loose
and if your back is turned that ruins
your morning
so this is the legome p64 it's 1500
and that's expensive even though it's
easily the cheapest of the grinders that
we're testing this week
but i think for the money there isn't a
better single-dosed
flat bird grinder in terms of workflow
in terms of performance in terms of
design and build
i find myself a little bit charmed by
this grinder much in the way that i was
charmed by the niche when i first
reviewed it
is it worth a thousand dollars more than
something like a niche
i can't answer that question because i
don't know what a thousand dollars means
to you
it's a difficult thing to answer there's
always diminishing returns but i don't
think it's outrageous in its pricing in
terms of its return and value for money
like i said for the money i can't think
of anything better
out there in the world right now but if
you know about something
drop it down in the comments below i'd
be i'd be interested to hear your
thoughts and i'd be interested to hear
if you have also got one of these and
how your experiences have been so far
have your issues match mine have your
positive experiences
match mine let me know down in the
comments below now i don't get to keep
this grinder this gets given away to one
of my patreon supporters they very
kindly support this channel and let me
go and buy and review these things
without a bias just buy them like a
consumer and not be beholden to
manufacturers
i'm very grateful to all of them for
that to allow me to to test
all of these grinders and there's
another review tomorrow we're going to
be looking at the weber workshops eg1
i hope you'll join me for that one and
the rest of this week on the ultimate
grinder
showdown i'll say thank you so much for
watching
i hope you have a great day
