## The Fellow Ode Grinder - 2020's Most Anticipated Coffee Product

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE4NT8MY-Zo>

Today we're gonna look at this.
It is probably the most
hyped product of 2020
when it comes to coffee at home.
It is a grinder by a
company called Fellow.
It is called The Ode.
Now they launched this on Kickstarter.
Now there are two types of
companies that use Kickstarter.
There's the kind of traditional kind,
what Kickstarter was set up for,
which is they wanna make a thing.
They've got a prototype,
but they can't afford some of
the costs of manufacturing.
So you're kind of helping
them kickstart a project
and make the thing.
Then there is a second kind of company
that has its manufacturing
pretty much locked down.
It's got as prototypes done,
and really it's using Kickstarter
to build hype, build interest
and pre-sell a product at a discount.
And that's unquestionably
what Fellow are doing with The Ode.
If you watch their video,
well, their Kickstarter
was trying to raise
a couple hundred thousand dollars.
The video promoting the Kickstarter
looks to me like a six figure video.
They spent a lot of money
marketing this thing.
So it was most definitely a pre-sale.
And in doing so,
they have perhaps set
expectations too high.
This is a $300 domestic coffee grinder
that will not and should
not, and is not designed
to do espresso.
It is built for filter coffee
and filter coffee only.
They are trying to do a good job
of that particular set of challenges.
They're not trying to compete
with something like the Niche
or grinders that are going
into that very fine espresso range.
So what I want to do today
is talk about the grinder.
I'm gonna split that into two parts.
The first part will be
the kind of features
and functionality of the grinder,
how it is to use the
little design decisions
that they've made
and how they might impact
your experience using it.
Then we'll get into what is
ultimately a conversation
about the burr set.
The burrs inside this
grinder are interesting.
They've made a bunch of decisions
that have a bunch of impacts
on you, the consumer,
and we are gonna talk about that.
One more quick note,
this grinder is a 110 volt US model.
I'm running it through
a very chunky converter
behind the scenes here.
This is not an EU model.
Fellow very kindly agreed to ship me one
from the US stock ahead of time,
because I wanted to get
on and review the product.
I was a Kickstarter Backer,
but I was expecting an EU unit.
It's also nice that when I give this away,
I can give it away to
someone on 110 volts,
instead of usually giving stuff
away to people on 220 volts.
Anyway, for now, let's get into
an overview of the grinder.
Now first and foremost,
this thing is very small.
It's beautifully small.
I think it's a very nicely designed.
It's beautiful looking, but it's tiny.
It's footprint is small.
It's clearance is very low.
It will fit under any kitchen
cupboards in the world.
To do that, they've also
pretty much gotten rid
of the hopper in a meaningful way.
It does have a bean hopper,
but it's designed for a single dosing.
It will hold up to 80 grams of coffee
though it's unlikely someone's
single dosing 80 grams
very often.
On the inside of the lid,
you do have a grind guide chart.
I think this is a bit of a mistake.
I think it's a good idea.
I just think the execution
has some problems,
but we'll come back to this
when we talk about the burr set itself.
Well, you've got your
standard safety protections
at the top of the hopper,
and you're designed to sort
of weigh what you need,
pour it in, hit go.
On the front,
you've got a very, very large step dial.
It feels very nice to adjust it.
I think the increments are fine enough
for a stepped grinder.
I don't think you need a step less grinder
in this kind of a situation.
I think stepped is absolutely fine.
And then the only other thing
that you're really interacting with
on the front of the grinder,
is the on off button here.
It does beep and I don't know why
because I know it's on,
I can hear the motor.
I don't need to be beeped
to be reminded of that.
But that aside, as you can hear,
the motor itself is actually pretty quiet.
And when it comes to grinding coffee,
this thing's also relatively quiet too.
Now they've done a couple of things
that are interesting here
with the ground catch bin.
As I think they're called.
Here, you'll see a magnet
and here is a magnet.
So this thing very
neatly clicks into place.
So it's always exactly
where it needs to be.
And that's nice.
Inside here the little lid has some fins
and this designed to help the
flow of pouring ground coffee.
One small complaint though,
is this little rubber lid,
unless it's perfectly seated,
if you don't quite get it on right,
then it doesn't do the
magnet thing properly.
So that for me is a
little tiny frustration
and what should be a very
pleasing experience otherwise.
One more thing before I forget
is it does have this thing,
a little knocker on the side of things.
Now these you see on
big commercial grinders,
it's got a bag knock usually,
or something like that.
It's designed to knock
out the last few grounds
that might be stuck inside
the exit chute of the grinder.
If I'm honest, it's a nice
idea, but it doesn't work.
And to explain how and why
let's grind some coffee.
Now, one quick thing early
on people were concerned
that the magnet at the bottom of this
would interfere with the load
cell of a nice weighing scale.
That hasn't been the case for me though.
It does stick and that's kind of annoying.
Again, this position
doesn't really its accuracy
in terms of the scale.
So I know that the weight is the weight.
I'm not worried about that.
But it is a slightly odd
part of the experience
when you're your beans bin
and your scale of sort of stuck together.
Coffee in.
Now I'll push go.
This grinder does have
an auto off detection.
You'll hear the coffee grind,
and then you'll hear it
run a little bit more
then it should switch off
pretty quickly after that.
(grinder engine roars)
Coffee done.
That took a little while.
Now, generally speaking, it
hasn't taken a long time.
Let me just click my bag
knocker and take this out.
Generally speaking,
it's maybe run four or five seconds over.
And occasionally it has
run a bit longer like that.
The way that this is working
is it sort of detecting
resistance in the burrs.
And so if a little bit of coffee
is retained somewhere somehow,
and it still feels a touch resistance.
It'll keep trying to grind it through.
So what we should have now is
all of the coffee out, right?
We put 15 grams in,
we should have 15 grams out.
That generally hasn't
always been the case.
Generally speaking there might've been
a little bit of coffee retained.
What you're starting to see right now,
here is a bit of static issue, right?
Quite a lot of chaff tends
to end up all over the place.
It's kinda messy on the lid here,
as well as inside the beans cup as well.
Now, these beans they might
guide the coffee effectively,
but they also trap it and
hold it back a little bit too.
And I find them a bit frustrating to use.
So a nice pour,
but obviously unless I keep shifting
and changing the angles,
it will retain some coffee in there.
And as you can see, I give it a tap.
There's just quite a lot of a static chaff
around the place.
The question is, did we get
everything out of the grinder?
If I go back and knock it now,
if the knocker was effective,
nothing should come out.
(knocker clicks)
That for me has been a consistent
aspect of this grinder,
just this retention of both chaff
and some final grounds there as well
in that kind of exit chute,
and then knocker straight away,
doesn't seem to be particularly effective
if there is a bit of
static electricity around
to really help it cling
onto the exit chute.
You can go to Fellow's website
and have a look at what they recommend
and what pleases me in a
funny sort of way is that
they recommend checking
out one of my videos
on a quick technique to reduce static.
And in that basically you just
add a tiny droplet of water
to your beans before you grind them.
And that really does help mitigate static.
So if you haven't seen this video,
essentially get a teaspoon,
get the handle a touch wet.
Just adding that tiny, tiny
droplet of water to the beans
really can make a big difference.
(grinder engine roars)
I mean that is very quick.
Little slow to notice
that it its empty though.
Better than the last time.
So that's usually about
as much as it runs over.
And honestly, I don't mind
it running over a little bit
because I'm usually doing other things
in the coffee making process
and not necessarily worrying about
is the grinder shutting
off by itself or not.
If it shuts off five or 10
seconds after it finishes,
that's fine by me.
So we do still have a bit of static,
some still inside here,
but it's a bit better
still some on the lid here.
You can just see that this
seems to just attract the chaff
from the coffee beans in particular,
but overall a slightly less
staticky messy experience.
Now this is a harsh environment
to review a grinder in.
We've got a dark worktop, a dark grinder.
This one, to be honest though,
is just a little bit messier
than any of the other domestic
grinders that I've used.
It's notably, messier than
say the Wilfa Uniform.
I think it's messier than the Niche,
but it's not the messiest grinder
I've ever used by any stretch.
Now I'm gonna brew some coffee
next we talk about the burr set.
Before I do that,
I think this is a really important point.
There was a lot of hype
about this grinder.
There was a lot of excitement
about this grinder,
and I think unfortunately,
expectations have been set too high.
Does this kind of meet
people's expectations?
That's a difficult question to answer.
Is this grinder worth $300?
Is there something better for
$300 that does a better job?
That's a different question to answer.
It's not about the hype.
It;s not about the excitement.
It's not about the newness
and the marketing campaign,
all of that kind of stuff.
Is it good value for money?
And as I'm critical of this,
you should know that I would
be critical of other grinders
at the same price point
for similar things.
Grinders like this tend to be a bit messy.
Grinders like this tend to
have a little bit of retention
in their systems.
This is not new or unusual.
This is competitive,
I think at its price point,
but let's brew some
coffee and talk about that
a little bit more.
(soft music)
Now just while the water heats
I've weighed out 30 grams of coffee,
I'm gonna brew a 30 to 500 pour-over.
Now their range says,
I really should be in the
sort of four to five zone.
And you would think a one cup pour-over
would therefore be closer to four,
maybe a two cup or three
cups close to five,
in my experience, this is way too coarse
for the kind of roast that
I'm typically working with.
In fact for this,
I'm gonna bring this down at sort of two
on the grind dial here,
which is a lot finer than
they would typically recommend
by this guide.
But if I brew coarser in their range,
the brew just happens very quickly.
And you might think, oh
does that mean less fines?
No, not necessarily.
It means the grind is just much coarser.
So let's grind this at two.
And let's say I put exactly 30 grams in.
Coming out, 29.1 actually.
So that suggests that there's quite
a lot of ground still stuck in here.
Yeah, there's a fair bit.
There's a fair bit stuck inside.
While this blooms, before
reviewing this grinder,
I put a kilo and a half
through the finest setting.
I then re-zero the burrs
according to Fellow's instructions,
because I thought that was a good point
to test this grinder out.
Brand new burrs do tend to produce
a slightly different grind profile
than burrs that have seen
a little bit of usage.
Sort of working burrs.
For keeping score,
I'm using the bagged
Tara filters with the tab
in case you wanna compare
your brew times to mine.
I'll let you know what the
total drawdown time is here.
And if you wanna know why
filter coffee papers matter,
there's a video up here too.
So that's a 320 brew
at the point that I'd finished
drawing down the liquid
and the bed went dry.
That's not a particularly
slow brew by any stretch
for this kind of a pour,
indicating that either there's no fines
or less fines than you might expect,
or that the grinders
perhaps or acceptable,
but almost it's still a tiny touch course.
I should say, this should be pretty close.
I'd be surprised if this
isn't a tasty cup of coffee,
but I would be thinking about brewing,
maybe a touch fine the next time
with this particular paper dose brew,
kind of set up that I have here.
While this cools, to speak to the brews
that I've had from this grinder so far,
I've had some very
enjoyable brews of coffee.
I haven't had a horrible taste profile
from a poor grind distribution.
It doesn't taste like it's
producing a ton of fines
or anything upsetting like that.
It doesn't taste like
this too many boulders
or large pieces of coffee coming through.
It tastes like it's doing
a really very good job,
grinding the coffee
and certainly comparable
to the best grinders
in that price point.
Now well that's still a
little bit hot it's pleasant,
but it is a little bit weaker,
it's a little bit under extracted for me.
I think I was right in
that I would wanna go,
the next time I brewed this,
I would wanna go a little bit finer.
This isn't the kind of brew
where I wanna throw it in
the sink and start again.
And I'm cross,
I would drink this in
the morning and be like,
man, it's tasty brew of coffee.
It could just be to be a
little bit more textured,
a little bit sweeter, a
little bit more complexity.
It just says I've ground
a little bit to coarse.
And that is, I think
one of the frustrations
with this grinder.
In that if I used darker
roast, this might be true.
But what is true in my particular world
is that pour-over is actually
finer than my cupping grind.
We did the world's largest
coffee tasting recently.
There's sort of two here.
Wouldn't be too far away
from what we used for a cupping grind.
My pour-over grind for a two cup
is actually finer than that cupping grind.
And if you still have
your reference sample,
it's not much finer, but
it is a little bit finer.
So for me, they're sort
of setting you up to fail
unless you're using more
developed, darker roasted coffee.
And that might be who they
think their audience is.
But amongst the people
that I see be excited
about this grinder,
hopeful for this grinder.
are a lot of people who
like lighter roasted coffee.
Now I brew a French press
at the same grind setting
that I brew a cupping at
because they're the
same brew method to me.
This is the same kind of technique.
Again, that's much finer
than most people expect.
Here for the French press,
there is an enormous
range, six through to 10,
almost entirely dedicated to French press
from Fellows perspective,
but that is way, way coarse
than anything I would
use for a French press.
Now I don't wanna get
drawn to this too much.
I presume that cold brew
could work at nine through 11.
And I presume they've made it go to 11
'cause they watched too
much spinal tap as well.
But for me, almost half of
what this grinder can do,
isn't usable grind size.
I don't ever really need to go that coarse
most of the time.
And my usable ground size really is only
this half of the dial,
which for me is a frustration,
especially because by the
time you get down to one,
I'm not sure if you bring a one cup V60
of light roasted coffee,
I'm not sure that's fine enough.
And how is that?
Why is that?
Why does this grind and not
go as fine, especially when,
as you adjust it, you
can hear the burrs touch?
And for that, we're gonna
have to open up the grinder
and talk about the decision they made
around the burrs themselves.
That is I think very interesting,
but it has a massive
impact on the capability
and range of this particular grinder.
(soft music)
If you wanna take apart the grinder,
there are a few videos
on Fellow's own website,
showing you how to do this.
Obviously unplug it.
So to start with you just take
off this front plate here.
So if you take off the first four screws
at north, south, east, west,
that allows this place to come off,
and that allows you then
to get in and adjust
and re-zero that front burrs position.
This is something you might wanna do
within the first month or
two of owning the grinder.
If you notice that it isn't
going as fine as it used to.
And there's a few more screws
and we can access the burrs themselves.
So this grinder is the moving burr here.
It's driven by the motor
and act against this stationary
burr here at the back.
You can see that the coffee exits
out of this little chute here,
and you can see actually
this quite a bit of buildup
here on the chute, which is not ideal.
Now the design of these burrs,
I think is very, very interesting.
They look initially
like regular flat burrs
and the way that those work is that
it's the gap between the burrs
that determines the grind size.
Here it's a little bit different.
These teeth on the edge of this bur,
stand up away from the
cutting surface here.
And this actually prevents the burrs
from getting too close
before they start to touch.
They're called interlocking burrs.
Because of the nature and the design
of the cutting teeth here,
you can't get the burrs any
closer without them touching
then produces actually a
relatively coarse grind.
With regular flat burrs,
when they're almost touching
that's when you're producing
this super fine grind,
this kind of espresso fine grind,
or even finer sometimes,
here this just isn't possible
because the burrs will touch and contact
and it can't be done.
And that to me is a very
interesting design decision
because you can put
regular flat burrs in here.
In fact, people have
already started changing
the burr sets out on this.
SSP a burr manufacturer
from Korea produces burrs
that fit this grinder that
are brew focused, flat burrs.
That will allow you to
go much, much, much finer
than the stock burrs would do.
However, you'd be taking a $300 grinder
and spending another $190 to upgrade it.
In the future, I might
look at that combination
and how it fares out say $500
compared to other $500 grinders.
But for now we're really
reviewing this as a stock item.
And so for me,
I really don't understand the decision
to go with interlocking burrs
on this particular grinder.
I did reach out to Fellow
and ask them this particular question.
At the time of recording,
they hadn't come back to me,
but if they do come back
to me, I'll cut me in,
telling you what they said.
So right after we finished recording,
I got an email from Fellow.
They said they picked
the interlocking burrs,
one, because of grinder distribution.
They looked at the kind of grind profiles
from various burrs.
They liked this one the best.
And secondly, they did taste testing too.
And again, they liked the
interlocking set the best.
They do acknowledge that
it doesn't go super fine.
And they said, they're
gonna work on two new burrs
that will be available
to Kickstarter Backers
at a deeply discounted rate.
Coming in the future they will let you go,
one to 200 microns finer.
So just bear all this in mind
as you watched the rest of the video.
Now I will be doing one
more video with this grinder
before I give it away.
I'll compare it to the Wilfa Uniform.
And then the XeoLeo.
I'm not sure about pronunciation actually.
It's been hard to find out.
A small ghost teeth grinder,
the cost $130 from AliExpress.
I'll put those three side-by-side
'cause I think they're an
interesting combination
in comparison of grinders
at different price points
with different availabilities.
This grinder after that will be given away
to one of my patron supporters.
They give me a budget each month
to go out and buy these
things and review them.
And I'm not relying on
manufacturers freebies or loners.
And I can give you an
honest, unbiased review.
And let's summarize the
review of this thing here.
It's $300.
And I think that puts it in
an interesting price point.
From a features perspective, it's pactful.
It's nice that it has an
auto off I think that's good,
even though it's not
super, super accurate,
that doesn't bother me.
The design I think is beautiful.
I think it's a lovely looking grinder.
I think the footprint is fantastic.
It is small.
It is neat.
It would look great in any kitchen.
I think they've done great
work with the design.
I think the grind setting experience,
the grinding experience is mostly good.
It's a pretty messy grinder.
I'd say it's a touch a messier
than other grinders at
that same price point.
But they are not perfect by any stretch,
but it is a little bit messy
when it comes to static
and chaff all around the place.
So ultimately the thing for me,
the deciding factor for you,
if you're thinking about buying this is,
does it grind and fine enough?
And for me, if I'm honest, it doesn't.
I want to go finer for a one cup pour-over
than this would let me.
I might wanna go finer
for Aeropress for example,
or even sometimes a mock-up on some cases,
this doesn't let me do that.
And that's frustrating.
If I was brewing more developed
coffees, darker roasts,
I wouldn't have a problem,
but I'm not.
And bring pretty light roasts
and trying to get the most complexity
and sweetness out of them.
That needs a fine grind.
I think it has a lot of
positives going for it.
I think they've tried to
pack it full of detail
though it hasn't always,
I think worked out as well
as they might have hoped.
There's tons of information
from Fellow on their website
about maintenance.
It's pretty easy to get
into, to look after,
it's easy to upgrade the burrs inside it.
And that does make it an
interesting proposition,
but again, as stock it's so
nearly what I want it to be,
but it's not quite there.
Now they've sold nearly 5,000
of these on the Kickstarter.
So there must be thousands
out there in the wild now.
Hopefully some of you
are watching this video,
I'd love to hear from you
down in the comments below,
did your experience mirror mine
or have you had a different one?
Is there something you love
that I didn't touch upon?
Is this something you hate
that I didn't touch upon?
I'd love to hear from you
down in the comments below,
but for now, I'll say thank
you so much for watching.
Hope you have a great day.
