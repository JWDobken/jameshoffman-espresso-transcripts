## The Mahlk√∂nig EK-43S (Episode #3)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROBoq7kYuNE>

welcome to episode
three of the ultimate grinder showdown
today we're looking at the malkonig
ek 43 s and i think it's safe to say
that this is probably the most
influential piece of coffee equipment
in the last 10 years first some history
of this company and this grinder
so malcolm as a company goes back to
1924 they weren't called malkonic then
but they made motors for grinders or
mixers or
food processing that kind of stuff they
began to concentrate on coffee grinders
in the 1960s and trade more heavily
under the mulchernick brand
they actually formally became malkernik
in 2005 but they're now part of the
hemorrhoid group
now at the end of the 1970s they began
to produce this model
now the name ek 43 is not a beautiful
name but it does make some sense
the e stands for ein farsenstrom which
is the german for single phase when it
comes to motors and things like grinders
whether it is single phase or three
phase
is really quite important and you'll
still see dk grinders from marconi which
is dry fasten storm
uh made today so if i fasten strong k
for cafe the german spelling of coffee
43 is the motor designation
there was a 23 they presumed there was a
33 but no one seems to know anything
about it
the s in this particular model is
because this is a
shorter version of that grinder there
were several different versions of this
grinder made for different things
there was one for pepper one for linseed
one for poppy seed one for grains
generally
and they had different letters after the
e so the ep
was for pepper in that particular case
it was a generally successful product
from its initial sort of beginnings it
had its fans it
had people who didn't really care about
it it did do a pretty cool version
called the ekk
which was sort of two hoppers two
grinders in one and that was kind of
fun but it wasn't really until around
2009 2010
that it had a dramatic change in its
trajectory and came
into the spotlight so in 2009 2010 a guy
called scott rayo
is experimenting with his one in a cafe
he was involved in the time called
caffeine myriad in montreal and he
noticed when brewing with his fatco that
he was able to push his extractions much
higher
than he'd expected to taste good 23 24
of the coffee being extracted back then
was a surprisingly high number
and that became part of the kind of
workflow in that cafe
it was an influential cafe and a few
different people came by and learnt
about this particular thing
one being a guy called ben kaminsky who
was the person who told me about this
whole thing
and another a guy called matt burger now
matt would hugely popularize this
grinder
by using it as part of his world bristol
championship routine and talking about
brewing espresso with this to to achieve
very high extraction yields
no one had really been doing that and
you know those of us had found out about
this we were starting to experiment and
try to understand
why was this doing this you know why
what was special about this grinder
in truth mel koenig themselves had no
idea this grinder was special
in fact it was slated to be discontinued
in 2013 though
the boom in its popularity obviously
prevented that from happening
it drove the conversation about more
unimodal grinding
more evenness in grinding and how that
can impact extraction how we can have
higher extractions
potentially better tasting coffee as a
result and this thing
just boomed in popularity malcolmic
could not make enough of these things
and today it still struggled to keep up
with demand they're a staple in just
about
every specialty coffee shop around the
world they are still
incredibly popular now despite all of
this despite its influence despite
how clearly excellent it is what it does
reviewing it here does
feel a little bit unfair of these five
grinders
this is different from the others
because it's built first and foremost
for a commercial environment that has a
number of different impacts but
we'll start with an obvious one which is
the price this thing typically costs
around
three thousand dollars but prices will
fluctuate because the distribution of
this grinder
is different to all the other grinders
i'm reviewing with the other grinders
i bought them direct from manufacturer
shipped from wherever they were in the
world
to me here with this with commercial
equipment
distribution works differently malcolm
egg would have built this grinder and
sold it
to a national distributor and that
national distributor probably didn't
sell it to an end user or to a cafe
it probably went through a dealer and so
typically with this kind of model you
end up with
the person who sells it to the cafe or
the end user being able to offer them
more support because they're
local to them or something like that but
this kind of distribution model means
that there are several businesses
between manufacturer and user
making some money and so while this
might be
a three thousand dollar grinder that
certainly is what malkonig as a
manufacturer would have charged for it
and so its distribution model is
definitely a challenge
when it comes to competing with these
other grinders however
marconi as a manufacturer has an
advantage that these other grinder
manufacturers do not
and that is scale malkonic builds tens
of thousands of grinders a year possibly
more
they they are manufacturing an enormous
number of these and that brings costs
down in both parts
and labor costs they have built uh
production around high volume
and and that makes it cheaper to make in
the case of some of these grinders
they're being built by hand by
passionate people who might even own the
company
that you're buying from it's a very
different model and that's worth
bringing up
and secondly because it's built for
cafes that has a massive impact on
its workflow and its purpose now in the
other grinders i've talked about
accessories
this comes with none nothing whatsoever
nothing to weigh into
nothing to grind into not a thing now
typically this might go to a cafe
who if they're using it for say batch
brewing they'd probably be weighing the
beans out in the paper filter
pouring it in and grinding back into the
paper filter for a fetco or a bun or
something like that i'm brewing that way
or most commonly they're going to use it
to grind a bag of coffee for a customer
to take home
a lot about this part of the grinder
here is is built around
grinding bags of coffee because that's
kind of what a lot of people use it for
and it needs to be very good at that at
home your requirements are very
different you're not going to be
grinding 100 grams of coffee for a fat
cobra you're going to be grinding 250
grams of coffee
for a bag of something to to give to a
friend or family member
realistically you're going to be
grinding 20 grams of coffee at a time
and i don't really think this is built
for that
i'm going to seem a little bit negative
about this because ultimately it does a
good thing
it grinds in a more uniform manner and
it helps coffee taste better at higher
extractions
that isn't really up for debate but it's
not built
really to do it in the home it's just
not and so
using it at home is often a less
enjoyable
experience than using it in a cafe is
now there have been lots of cafes that
have tried to adapt this to
to grind coffee for every single
espresso that they pull
and you've seen people sort of create
and manufacture
additional items to help make that a
more enjoyable part of the process
but those are expensive and ultimately
it's still kind of a convoluted workflow
but let's talk through the grinder just
very quickly you can see at the back
here a very large
motor mounted on this little stand here
the normal ek
has a larger piece here raising it up
higher making it easier to get a bigger
bag underneath
people began modding these themselves
and so malconus kind of copied that and
made a shorter version the dial on the
front
goes from zero round to 16 and that's
your grind setting and again
smaller the number finer the grind at
zero you're typically finer than you
would need for espresso
and at 16 you're probably coarser than
you would need for something like a
french press or something else that you
might want to brew with a coarse grind
maybe cold brew if that's your thing it
really does cover a full grind spectrum
and it does grind well across
every setting one small complaint from
the get-go is that they built this model
to be
shorter and that's good especially for
the home but what they chose to do was
put on a very
large hopper on the top of it i don't
really understand why they decided to
put such a long tall hopper here
if they're making a shorter grinder it
really makes no sense to me
i will also say that the quality control
on the hoppers generally has been a bit
of a problem i broke this hopper
almost instantly upon sort of using it
it's got quite a difficult mechanism
that it locks onto the top of this with
there's a little gasket inside here and
it sort of clicks in
in the case of this one the glue around
the edge here and on here
was very poorly done and so it came
almost straight off when i tried to
unlock the hopper
that's really disappointing and
ultimately this should be a better piece
i i will say that replacing this with a
better hopper would be high on my list
if i had one of these at home in
addition the hopper has a little sort of
gate
on there some of the old ones would have
a gate that swung out but remained
attached
so you didn't pull it all the way out
this one you pull all the way out and i
don't
actually like that because getting it
back in again is a bit fussy you've got
your
vertically mounted bur set here a very
large person as well
coffee drops sort of through them and
down that's a very smart way to approach
things now in terms of accessing the
burrs on this thing it's not
particularly
difficult but it does require tools so
you're going to open up the two screws
here
you'll be able to take this front piece
off and access the burrs that way
it's not a particularly painful thing
but it's not as easy as some of the
other grinders in there but once you're
inside you'll see there's some
some pretty chunky burrs in there now
the styling on this grinder is i would
say iconic at this point but i don't
think it's it's
super beautiful if you look back at some
of the grinders they used to make like
the w1bn
which was built in the 50s and 60s that
i think is super beautiful
and here end of the 70s beginning of the
80s a lot more boxier straight lines
i think that's kind of a shame now i
guess what we should do is probably pull
a shot of espresso
and talk about that part of the process
now again i'm going to be using a spray
bottle
for my doses because it does reduce the
staticky mess around one of these things
again it doesn't come with a spray
bottle there's no recommendation to use
one
but from my point of view i certainly
prefer it that way now when you're
groaning for espresso you're obviously
not going to put a portafilter
underneath it here because
a terrible mess wouldn't see you and
that's just that's just not recommended
i'm going to use that little dosing cup
from a niche grinder because that works
super well
it's a little bit surprising to me that
the ek-43s in particular does not come
with something to grind into
the s is definitely more popular with
people at home rather than cafes but
you get nothing which is kind of a shame
now when it comes to grinding the motor
is relatively loud
but it does grind very quickly
now it does have a very effective
knocker but that's really built to be a
bag knocker
you can see from the shape of this piece
here this is designed for a retail bag
to sit inside a retail bag and the
knocker
is designed to prevent a buildup of
ground coffee around the exit here
keep it moving into the bag below it
works fine to help clear it but this
whole
awkward piece here really isn't designed
for dosing some coffee for an espresso
shot
now with the style of espresso that
people pull on an ek it's typically a
longer shot it's not like a two to one
it's more like a
three to one in some cases a much larger
espresso and that's very common for
unimodal style grinders
the espresso you get from it is balanced
it is sweet it is
clean but it doesn't have a ton of
texture and that's a function of both
unimodal grinders
as well as those larger espresso ratios
that you typically
use to get good espresso from them i
enjoy this style of espresso though i
often find myself missing a little bit
of texture now when it comes to dialing
these things in
they are fussy and finicky and quite
frustrating
retention is a little bit of an issue
with this grinder wherein
you'd almost benefit from a little purge
in between grind settings in a way that
some other grinders don't really need
but with this one
i would recommend it otherwise you can
find yourself chasing a grind setting
around and around and around
and in my experience where a coffee
might be set
first thing in the morning or on one day
you might need to dial it in again
the next day it's a little bit more
of a chase some people don't really
struggle with this but i've generally
needed to re-dial in
fairly often with this with one
particular coffee your mileage may vary
now this is probably more commonly used
for filter coffee than it is for
espresso
and we'll be testing filter coffee
extractions against the other grinders
in that big showdown video at the end of
this week obviously
it's very good at what it does otherwise
it wouldn't have had the impact that it
had it wouldn't have become
the most popular grinder in specialty
coffee shops around the world it would
have generated
the hype the interest the research
everything that's gone along with it
this is a
hugely influential grinder and you can't
really argue that it isn't good or what
it does
when you look at the impact that it's
had on the coffee industry
and so you you might be a little bit
confused because initially it seems like
i've had a bit of a rant against this
thing
but now i'm saying it's great at what it
does and i feel like i'd hold those two
opinions and
not feel any cognitive dissonance it is
a great grinder
for a cafe i don't really think it
belongs at home
in these videos we haven't talked a ton
about alignment how
perfectly aligned the two bows are to
make sure there's no wobbling or no
variance in grind sizes they spin
historically ek-43s have needed some
help with alignment and
and that's frustrated a lot of people
this is an expensive grinder
why doesn't it come out of the box
perfectly aligned
and i can't speak on behalf of malkonic
here but
the number of grinders they're dealing
with is so much higher than almost any
other manufacturer
who's obsessing about these kind of
tolerances historically
these have kind of been all over the
place sometimes you know that the
alignment had been a problem
and with all of these reviews i'm not
touching that with these grinders i'm
reviewing them as
stock because i think that's fair as a
consumer you should review what you get
you shouldn't be reviewing the modified
tweaked
improved versions of those things but it
has been an issue with these grinders
and
it is seemingly getting better though i
do worry a little bit about the qc with
them with the volume that they're
producing
and it's the little details it's the
fact that my hopper broke
almost instantly it's the fact that
these stickers which they've now changed
but
mine are just peeling off already and
it's less than a month old these
little details they do bother me and
they would bother me all the more if i
bought this to use at home
where i have a different kind of
relationship than i would do in a cafe
where i need it to be a workhorse
and it is a good solid workhorse and so
i can't avoid talking about this grinder
as part of this week's grinder reviews
because it is
so influential it is so important in
coffee
but it does sit out of place compared
to the other grinders because it's built
for a cafe and it's not built for home
i will continue to buy these for
businesses i will continue to use these
almost every day but would i recommend
that you put one in your home
i don't know you'd have to think
carefully about your workflow how you
want to work and
for the price point does it deliver the
best results
i will say it produces greatest in
coffee no question and when they're very
well aligned
really delicious coffee really very good
i have no complaints about the quality
that these things can produce
at all but i am looking forward to
pitting it head to head in both espresso
and filter coffee against these other
grinders now i don't get to keep this
one
i'm going to give this one away to one
of my patreon backers because patreon
gives me a budget every month to go and
buy
these grinders not be relying on
freebies or loans all that kind of stuff
i can buy them
review them tell you my honest thoughts
and at the end i can give them away
and that makes me very happy but now i
want to hear from you down in the
comments below
tens of thousands of people around the
world have these in businesses and in
homes
let me know your experience do your
frustrations mirror my frustrations have
you modded it adapted it in some way
do you like what i like did i miss
something i want to hear from you
down in the comments below but for now i
say thank you so much for watching
i hope you have a great day
