## The Exciting Potential Of Amazonian Robusta?

So, you've probably heard about robusta
sometime in your life.
The dark, bitter, low quality coffee,
or is it really?
Hi, my name is Rodrigo Torii.
I'm a roaster, photographer,
and video producer based in Brazil.
I've been roasting here in
Manaus for a couple of years now,
and since the beginning,
I was looking for a good quality,
locally-produced coffee.
You see, generally speaking,
robustas aren't praised by its quality.
You often find it pre-ground
and overly roasted.
In the cup, you taste
leathery and ashy notes.
By treating it as a commodity,
this stigma is created.
However, with proper care and handling,
the results can be incredibly good.
When a friend showed me
this Amazonian robusta,
I knew that something was different.

The espresso is balanced
with nice sweetness
and a touch of acidity, much
different than I was used to.
But at the same time,
James has just posted his
guest creator takeover,
so I thought, "Yeah, this is it."
So I pitched the idea
to investigate further
and oh my god, he approved!
(upbeat music)
After a quick trip to Cacoal
in the state of Rondônia,
I've managed to talk to a
couple of local producers
and also with a researcher
from Embrapa in Porto Velho.
Here's what I've discovered.
Number one: you cannot
expect a good quality coffee
if you don't treat it right.
Ever since I've heard
about quality coffee,
canephoras were treated
as commodity, as inferior.
So investment and research
throughout the whole chain is essential.
Number two: now that you
have a good foundation,
one way to enhance the experience
is through different
post-processing methods.
Here's where the magic happens.
Remember that coffee
that I've talked about
in the beginning of the video?
It went through a
semi-carbonic maceration,
which is much simpler
than the name suggests.
After picking and washing
the fully ripe cherries,
you put them whole in a
clean, sealable plastic drum
with a one-way valve on the top.
The key here is not to let
any more air enter the system,
only exit.
So, in the beginning there
is still plenty of oxygen
inside the reservoir.
But as the fermentation occurs,
the CO2 produced expels the oxygen,
creating an anaerobic environment.
At the bottom of the tank,
cherries get squeezed by the
weight of the cherries above.
In the top layer of the tank,
cherries get only fermented.
This mixture of processes
creates complex flavors,
bringing more acidity,
herbal, and fruity notes.
However, it is important
to don't overdo it.
Controlling the temperature
and the time of fermentation
is crucial here.
Also, opening the lid in
the middle of the process
is a no-go.
Over-fermented coffees are very unpleasant
and that's why it's super
important to follow the protocols.
So, by implementing a simple
process with simple tools,
producers in the middle
of the Amazon forest
and anywhere in the world,
now have another way of
presenting their coffee
with high added value.
By investing in quality
and post-processing,
we'll ensure the
preservation of the Amazon
because there is no need to deforest.
Robustas have a high productivity,
so farmers only need a small piece of land
to make a good living.
I'll be interested in hearing
your thoughts, though.
Is there a place for a good quality,
nicely-produced robusta in the world?
Or is it just nonsense?
The future should be 100% arabica?
Is fermenting bad?
Let me know your thoughts
down in the comments below.

- In my opinion,
  I think very well-controlled
  fermentation processes
  should definitely be widespread
  throughout the country,
  especially because there's
  still so much for us to discover
  in terms of potential
  for Brazilian coffees.
- What is happening right now,
  especially with producers
  in Espirito Santo
  producing canilon and in
  Rondônia producing robustas,
  is that they woke up for quality
  and they are making some experiments
  and the results,
  I am just in awe with beautiful coffees
  that I am trying so far.
- Do I love canephoras?
  No, I don't.
  Do I love the fact
  that we can push quality harder with them?
  Yes, I do.
  And that's actually why
  we have one of them here
  at the Coffee Lab.
  We roast a very good lot of conilon,
  which is the varietal here in Brazil.
  It's washed, it's fruity, it's
  weird, compared to arabicas.
  And I like the fact that this canephora
  doesn't try to be arabica.
  I've tried so many, since 2000 I guess,
  so many canephoras around the world
  and some of them try to be arabicas
  and I don't think that's the way.
  So, that's it.
  I like having the possibility
  to show quality either
  way, arabicas or canephoras.
- If this is just the beginning,
  I'm thrilled with what the future holds.
  If more and more consumers
  and producers seek quality,
  not only we are going to taste
  and experience awesome coffees,
  but also we will ensure the
  preservation of these ecosystems
  and have a huge impact in
  the lives of these people.
  Finally, I would like to
  say thank you very much
  to James Hoffmann for
  giving me this opportunity,
  and thank you for watching.
  I hope you have a great day.
