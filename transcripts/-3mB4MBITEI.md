## The Weber EG-1 (Episode #2)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3mB4MBITEI>

welcome to episode 2 of the ultimate
grinder showdown week
today we're looking at the eg1 from
weber workshops
this is a three and a half thousand
dollar grinder
and it is a grinder obsessed with detail
webble workshop started out back in 2014
as lynne webber
craig lin i think departed the company
in 2018 and it became weber workshops
this is their electric grinder i assume
eg they do
a hg as well which is a hand grinder but
this is the one that i was very
interested in now a lot has been made
over the years over douglas weber's
history as one of the team that worked
on the apple ipod
his background is in manufacturing and
design and it really
it really shows in this particular
grinder
and i think a good introduction to it is
just to sort of walk you from top
to bottom and highlight some of the
details in the build construction
and sort of the way that this thing
works that i think is just
stunning starting at the top of the
grinder you can see the sort of fan at
the top here keeping the motor cool
moving down you've got a beautiful
little bean funnel this is attached
on two locking pins and a magnet so you
don't actually need any tools to detach
it
those magnets are going to become a
little bit of a theme for this grinder
moving down we have the locking ring
here for your ground setting and this is
the only grinder that we're going to
look at
in this whole week that actually locks
its ground setting now that locking does
mean it is
a stepped grinder so you can see the
little markings here for each step you
lift this
move it and drop it down into whichever
step final or course of that you want to
go
as you'd expect moving towards smaller
numbers takes you finer moving towards
larger numbers takes you courser
the steps i think are small enough
certainly there are times where i wish
they were a little tiny bit smaller but
i'm being very fussy there
i've never really had any major issues
dialing in an espresso to be just the
way that i want them
moving down we end up with this little
platform here and on this is the blind
shaker
that is the one accessory that comes
with this that i'll talk about a little
bit more in a second
now this platform is on a spring so you
can tilt it forward to easily remove it
and that way when it's sat there the
shaker is sat close to the exit shoot to
minimize
mess or sort of spray from the static
this button here
allows you to move it up and down as you
wish it's a very nice little detail
beyond that you've got a start stop
button and you've got a dial
here for controlling the rpm of the
grinder and this runs up to about 1800
rpm
which is probably higher than you'd want
to go i've generally run this at about
600 rpm most of the time that isn't
where the detail finishes
and just looking at it touching it you
can see the the machining tolerances are
tiny everything fits together
beautifully this is manufactured and
assembled in taiwan
and ships from there at the moment
coming around the side
small little bean knocker that i think
is a nice little detail but it's
attached to
these outer pieces here and this is i
think
just a little piece of magic this is
where the burs are inside the grinder so
if you want to access the burs
this pulls up this comes out
and and you've actually exposed the
birds they're sat
right here inside the grinder very close
to each other because we're an espresso
setting right now
but that's it if you want to clean that
burr chamber
no tools required whatsoever
that i think is is beautiful it's it's
so elegant it's so nicely done
they fit together so nicely and
everything feels
just just really really well made
and it would need to be because this
thing is three and a half
thousand dollars that is incredibly
expensive for a coffee grinder so you'd
really want to know where your money is
going and build
design is unquestionably a big part of
that let's put it back together
i mean that's just ridiculous isn't it
how simple is that and then you have
your your one accessory to this which is
the blind shaker
essentially inside you've got this piece
that acts as a
sort of stopper at the bottom of this
sort of catch bin
so this drops in and you would grind
into this thing
this sits on top to hold everything in
place so you can give it a good shake
that would get rid of any clumps
help with better sort of distribution of
particles and then you would place this
on your portafilter and ultimately
pull this out and the coffee would fall
through it into the water filter below
everything fits together very well feels
very nice feels very solid
and well made now the grinder does not
come with a little spray bottle
and i prefer to use a little spray
bottle with this
from a sort of messiness perspective
having the the blind shaker sit pretty
close to the exit shoot does reduce mass
but if you don't do this you do get a
bit of static you will see some chaff
rounded about the grinder and that can
be frustrating a little bit messy
let's pull a shot
[Applause]
now as you watch the rpm counter as well
as listen to the grinder
you can hear that the grinder is trying
to achieve the desired rpm and it's
doing that by
varying the amount of power being sent
to the motor to try and keep it
at that rpm it will drift around a
little bit so if your target is 600 it
will sometimes be below sometimes above
it'll kind of wander around
when you finally clear the coffee from
the burset
it's suddenly easier to spin faster so
the rpm will go up and then come back
down again
it's not my favorite part of this
grinder i like that the rpm is
controllable
but that's true of most of the grinders
we're going to test this week i don't
love the way it executes that
it just doesn't sound as nice as this
grinder feels and looks and generally is
to use
i don't think it's doing anything bad to
the coffee by any stretch
it's just it's just a complaint of mine

once you've removed your central piece
there you need to give it a little swell
and then it will distribute generally
pretty well

so let's talk about the burst set this
grinder comes with their core
bur set which is a little bit like the
lagom p64
a hybrid burst you can get a more
unimodal set
as an additional sort of upgrade or
add-on so to speak
but this one is designed for both
espresso and brewed coffee
and i think it works well profile wise
it's closer
to a sort of more unimodal profile where
espresso is sweet and clean and balanced
but not a ton of texture
but not absent texture either i think
it's a nice sort of hybrid bur from that
perspective
there are other options that are more
espresso focused as well
and if you're using this is nothing but
a brewed coffee grinder then i would
consider the upgrade to a unimodal burst
that or a more unimodal burst at any way
now you might think that the blind
shaker is really built for espresso but
i actually really like it for most
filter coffee applications it's a nice
way to distribute coffee bang into the
center of v60
you can get coffee into an aeropress
with a little funnel it works well for
most brewing methods
i don't have any issues with that i
don't wish it came with something
different for grinding for filter coffee
and it's profile for filter coffee we
will discuss in more depth
in the head-to-head review at the end of
the week where it'll be much more
comparative tasting between all of these
grinders now one thing that i really
love about the setup of this grinder
is the way that the burrs are mounted on
this thing
in most grinders you'll expect to see
two sometimes three
screws in the burrs holding them in
place that is not the case with this
grinder
on this grinder the birds are held in
place by a combination of pins and
magnets again
that means that the the burrs themselves
have no
unusual holes in them for putting screws
through now a lot of people worry about
what happens if they chip a little bit
of a bur if a stone or something gets
into their coffee
right that's small damage to one of the
cutting teeth does that ruin your
espresso
i i don't think it does but it will have
an impact much the same way that in
every burst set
having three holes that don't have
cutting teeth inside them
must impact the burr set with this it's
completely uniform
every piece of the bur is the same all
the way around and i think that's super
cool and i think that does help
produce excellent results in the cup so
to summarize
let's talk through the things that i
like and the things that i don't like as
much
what i like unquestionably is the build
it's it's so well made every detail just
feels thought through
the the materials choice it looks
beautiful
this is a incredibly well made thing and
that brings me pleasure
to look at in the morning to use day to
day i think the way that it comes to
pieces
is incredibly thoughtful as well i love
that you can access
the bird chamber with zero tools in less
than 10 seconds i think the detail
everywhere from the spring lever here
the little thwacker at the back there
it's all great
detail i think it makes delicious coffee
incredibly enjoyable
it is a big grinder there's no denying
this it's tall
it went for under most counter tops it's
relatively wide
it's not that deep but it is a big
pretty heavy thing
this may not fit in every home but if
you've got space in your kitchen
and or space wherever you make your
coffee that would probably look pretty
great there i think it can be a bit
messy
if you don't use a little spray bottle
now and again and that has been a
frustration
when i've used lighter roasted coffees
that do have a little bit more chaff
around them
i wish the the way that it sounded when
it's grinding
sounded a little bit different i wish it
wasn't hunting out its desired rpm and
sort of
moving around in that manner it doesn't
reassure me the way that the build of
this thing does
overall i don't think it impacts coffee
but it does
somewhat impact my experience then
there's the price
it's three and a half thousand dollars
before it is shipped to you wherever you
are in the world and i paid about 150
in shipping that is a staggering amount
of money
whether it's worthwhile is a question
you have to ask yourself and it's not
the only grinder we'll look at
at that kind of a price point but it is
incredibly expensive
but you see where your money is going
and i think that's important
i think that's what you want to see
every detail here has been considered
every materials choice has obviously
been considered and that's
that's hard not to like it's a very
aesthetic experience it's very enjoyable
i am impressed do i wish it was cheaper
absolutely
do i think it's overpriced no i do not
it's a small company
producing a small number of beautiful
things they're not buying
tens of thousands of pieces to bring the
costs down they don't have scale to
bring that cost down
and so i am understanding of that high
high price but if you've got the cash
if this appeals to you then i think
you'll have a very enjoyable coffee
experience
with this grinder i don't get to keep
this particular grinder because this
goes to one of my patreon supporters
because my patreon supporters give me a
budget every month to go and buy
equipment to review for you
and because i buy it i don't get loners
or freebies from manufacturers
the reviews i hope are unbiased i'll
certainly miss having this grinder
around
and if you want to know which one of
these five that i would keep
well then you'll have to watch the
head-to-head coming
a little bit later if it's live there'll
be a link in the description down below
if not i hope you tune in very soon for
the next episode of this ultimate
grinder showdown
for now i'll say thank you so much for
watching i hope you have a great day
